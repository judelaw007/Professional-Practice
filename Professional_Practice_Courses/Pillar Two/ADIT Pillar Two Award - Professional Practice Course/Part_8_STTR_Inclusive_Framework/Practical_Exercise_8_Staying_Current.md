# Practical Exercise 8: Staying Current

## Introduction

This practical exercise concludes the ADIT Pillar Two Professional Practice Course by applying the monitoring and governance concepts from Part 8. Unlike calculation-focused case studies in earlier Parts, this exercise develops the ongoing professional skills essential for maintaining Pillar Two compliance in a dynamic regulatory environment.

**Context:** You are the Pillar Two compliance lead at Stratos Holdings plc. It is now January 2026. The MNE Group has completed its first full GloBE calculation cycle for FY 2025 (as covered in Case Study 7). Your role now shifts from initial implementation to ongoing compliance maintenance.

**Time estimate:** 90-120 minutes

---

## Background: Stratos's Compliance Landscape — January 2026

### Current Status

Stratos has successfully:
- Filed its first GIR for FY 2025 with the UK as Designated Filing Entity
- Calculated total Top-up Tax liability of €1,242,558 (IIR €807,518 + Ireland QDMTT €435,040)
- Applied Transitional Safe Harbour to 5 of 7 jurisdictions
- Established baseline compliance processes

### Ongoing Challenges

The Pillar Two landscape continues to evolve:
- OECD Administrative Guidance releases occur 2-3 times annually
- Jurisdictions continue implementing and refining domestic QDMTT legislation
- The Inclusive Framework's peer review outcomes affect safe harbour eligibility
- Stratos's business activities may trigger new compliance considerations (STTR exposure, M&A, restructuring)

### Key Stakeholders

| Role | Name | Primary Concerns |
|------|------|------------------|
| Group CFO | Margaret Chen | Board reporting, financial statement impact, resource allocation |
| Group Tax Director | James Wilson | Technical compliance, risk mitigation, process efficiency |
| Head of Tax Technology | Priya Sharma | System updates, data quality, automation opportunities |
| External Auditor | Ernst & Co. | Audit trail, documentation standards, control environment |
| Audit Committee | Board members | Governance oversight, risk appetite, materiality thresholds |

## Task 1: Administrative Guidance Monitoring Memo

### Scenario

The OECD has released new Administrative Guidance in December 2025 (hypothetical). James Wilson has asked you to prepare a summary memo identifying guidance relevant to Stratos's compliance position.

### Your Task

Using the official OECD resources and the monitoring framework from Chapter 8.5, identify and analyse administrative guidance updates relevant to Stratos's Pillar Two compliance.

**Note:** For this exercise, assume the OECD has issued "AG6" in December 2025 containing the following topics (based on realistic anticipated guidance areas):
- Clarification on QDMTT Safe Harbour application for partial-year acquisitions
- Additional guidance on treatment of Marketable Transferable Tax Credits
- Simplifications for Transitional Safe Harbour extensions
- Guidance on STTR interaction with treaty override provisions

### Deliverable

Prepare a **Technical Memo** (2-3 pages) addressed to James Wilson covering:

#### Required Sections

**1. Executive Summary** (Half page)
- Key guidance items affecting Stratos
- Priority actions required
- Timeline for implementation

**2. Guidance Analysis** (1-1.5 pages)

For each relevant AG6 item, address:

| Analysis Element | Content Required |
|-----------------|------------------|
| **Guidance Topic** | Specific AG6 provision |

| Guidance Item | Stratos Impact | Quantitative Effect (if any) | Implementation Deadline |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| QDMTT partial-year | TechStart acquisition treatment | €[estimate] | FY 2025 filing |
| MTTC clarification | USA entities | €[estimate] | Immediate |
| TSH extensions | Safe Harbour jurisdictions | Process change | FY 2026 |
| STTR interaction | Future treaty applications | Policy update | Ongoing |

**4. Recommended Actions** (Half page)
- Immediate actions (within 30 days)
- Short-term actions (within 90 days)
- Process updates (ongoing)

### Resources to Consult

Apply the resource navigation skills from Chapter 8.5:

| Resource | Purpose | Access |
|----------|---------|--------|
| OECD Pillar Two portal | Primary AG source | oecd.org/tax/beps/pillar-two |
| Consolidated Commentary | Article-by-article guidance | OECD iLibrary |
| Central Record of Legislation | Jurisdictional status | OECD Central Record |

## Task 2: Tax Governance Policy Update

### Scenario

Following the first year of Pillar Two compliance, Margaret Chen (Group CFO) has requested an update to Stratos's internal tax governance documentation. The existing Tax Risk Management Policy predates Pillar Two implementation and requires revision.

### Your Task

Draft updates to Stratos's **Tax Risk Management Policy** to incorporate Pillar Two requirements, ensuring alignment with the compliance processes established during FY 2025.

### Deliverable

Prepare **Policy Update Documentation** containing:

#### Section A: Policy Amendment Drafting (1-2 pages)

Draft new policy sections to be inserted into the existing Tax Risk Management Policy:

**A.1 Pillar Two Compliance Governance**

Include provisions covering:

| Policy Area | Required Content |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Ownership** | Designation of Pillar Two compliance owner, reporting lines |
| **Scope** | Entities and jurisdictions covered by Pillar Two processes |
| **Materiality** | Thresholds for escalation and Board reporting |
| **Review Cycle** | Frequency of process reviews and policy updates |

**A.2 Three Lines of Defence — Pillar Two**

Map Pillar Two responsibilities to the governance model:

```
FIRST LINE: Operational
├── Data collection and validation
├── Jurisdictional calculations
├── GIR preparation
└── Entity-level compliance

SECOND LINE: Risk & Compliance
├── Methodology validation
├── Policy interpretation
├── Cross-jurisdictional coordination
└── Regulatory monitoring

THIRD LINE: Independent Assurance
├── Process audits
├── Control testing
├── External audit liaison
└── Board reporting
```

Specify for each line:

**Complete the matrix using:**
- **R** = Responsible (does the work)
- **A** = Accountable (final decision authority)
- **C** = Consulted (provides input)
- **I** = Informed (receives updates)

#### Section C: Stakeholder Communication Plan (Half page)

Draft a brief communication plan for distributing the policy updates:

| Stakeholder Group | Communication Method | Key Messages | Timing |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|--------|
| Audit Committee | Board paper | Governance enhancements, risk mitigation | Q1 2026 |
| Local Finance Teams | Training session | Process responsibilities, data requirements | Within 60 days |

## Model Answer Guidance

### Task 1: AG Monitoring Memo

**Key Points to Address:**

For the hypothetical AG6 on partial-year acquisitions:
- Stratos acquired TechStart on 1 July 2025
- Guidance clarifying QDMTT Safe Harbour application for partial-year entities directly affects FY 2025 calculations
- Impact: Potential adjustment to TechStart entities' safe harbour eligibility
- Action: Review calculations before GIR filing

For MTTC clarification:
- Stratos has US entities potentially affected
- Cross-reference with AG5 existing MTTC guidance
- Impact: May affect USA jurisdictional ETR calculation
- Action: Confirm treatment of any US tax credits

For TSH extensions:
- 5 of 7 Stratos jurisdictions currently qualify for Transitional Safe Harbour
- Extensions affect planning horizon for full calculations
- Impact: Resource planning for transition to full calculations
- Action: Update compliance calendar

**Professional Memo Elements:**
- Formal addressing and sign-off
- Clear section headings
- Quantified impacts where possible
- Specific deadlines and responsible parties

### Task 2: Tax Governance Policy

**RACI Matrix Solution:**

| Process | Group Tax | Local Finance | Tax Technology | External Advisor | CFO | Audit Committee |
|---------|-----------|---------------|----------------|------------------|-----|-----------------|
| Annual GIR preparation | A | R | R | C | I | I |
| Safe Harbour assessment | R | C | I | C | I | I |
| QDMTT calculation | A | R | R | C | I | I |
| AG impact assessment | R | I | C | C | I | I |
| Board reporting | R | I | I | C | A | I |
| External audit support | R | R | C | C | I | I |

**Policy Language Tips:**
- Use "shall" for mandatory requirements
- Use "should" for recommended practices
- Define all acronyms
- Include version control and approval signatures

### Task 3: Board Reporting

**Appropriate Tone:**
- Avoid technical jargon (explain ETR as "effective tax rate")
- Lead with compliance status (good news first)
- Quantify financial impact prominently
- Keep recommendations specific and actionable

**Data to Include (from Case Study 7):**
- Total liability: €1,242,558
- IIR: €807,518 (Cayman €278,110 + Singapore €529,408)
- QDMTT: €435,040 (Ireland)
- 5/7 jurisdictions qualifying for safe harbour
- Filing deadline: 30 June 2027 (transitional)

**Forward-Looking Elements:**
- Singapore QDMTT implementation (reduces future IIR)
- Transitional safe harbour expiration timeline
- Resource needs for transition to full calculations

## Reflection Questions

After completing the exercise, consider:

1. **Monitoring Efficiency:** How would you structure ongoing AG monitoring to minimise time while ensuring nothing is missed?

2. **Governance Balance:** How do you balance thorough documentation against practical resource constraints?

3. **Board Communication:** What level of detail is appropriate for directors who are not tax specialists?

4. **Change Management:** How would you handle a significant mid-year guidance change that affects filed returns?

5. **Professional Judgement:** When guidance is ambiguous, how do you document your interpretation and manage risk?

### Continuing Professional Development

Pillar Two compliance requires ongoing learning:

1. **Monitor OECD releases** — Apply Chapter 8.5 monitoring framework
2. **Track peer review outcomes** — Watch Central Record updates
3. **Follow jurisdictional implementation** — National legislation changes affect calculations
4. **Engage with professional bodies** — ADIT, CIOT, and other bodies provide updates
5. **Practice with real scenarios** — Apply skills to actual client or employer situations

### Final Thought

> *"The GloBE rules represent the most significant change to international taxation in a generation. Mastering the technical rules is essential—but sustainable compliance requires building processes, governance, and monitoring capabilities that evolve with the framework."*

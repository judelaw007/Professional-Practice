# Chapter 8.2: STTR Implementation

## Learning Objective

After completing this chapter, you will be able to distinguish between the Multilateral Convention and bilateral treaty approaches to STTR implementation, understand the ratification and entry into force process, identify which jurisdictions have committed to implement the STTR, and determine when the STTR will apply to specific bilateral treaty relationships.

## Introduction

The STTR's implementation path differs fundamentally from the GloBE Rules. While jurisdictions can unilaterally enact domestic legislation implementing IIR, UTPR, and QDMTT, the STTR requires modification of bilateral tax treaties—a process that inherently involves two sovereign parties and established diplomatic procedures. This distinction creates both challenges and opportunities: the bilateral nature slows implementation but also ensures that STTR obligations arise only where both parties have explicitly agreed.

The OECD developed the STTR Multilateral Convention (STTR MLI) to accelerate this process, recognising that bilateral renegotiation of thousands of treaties would take decades. The STTR MLI allows jurisdictions to modify multiple treaties simultaneously through a single instrument, dramatically reducing the administrative burden. However, the mechanism still requires matching commitments from both treaty partners—a treaty only becomes covered when both parties have signed, ratified, and notified that specific treaty.

Understanding the implementation timeline is essential for compliance planning. The STTR will not affect most MNE groups immediately; the first Covered Tax Agreements will likely take effect in 2026 at the earliest, and the network will expand gradually as more jurisdictions complete ratification. Practitioners must monitor this evolving landscape to anticipate when specific bilateral relationships will trigger STTR obligations.

## Overview: Two Implementation Paths

The STTR is a **treaty-based rule**. Unlike the GloBE Rules (implemented through domestic legislation), the STTR must be incorporated into bilateral tax treaties. There are two implementation paths:

```

│ STTR IMPLEMENTATION PATHS                                           │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The choice between implementation paths reflects practical considerations about treaty network management. Jurisdictions with extensive treaty networks—particularly developing countries seeking to implement STTR across multiple relationships—find the MLI approach attractive because it achieves modifications efficiently. The bilateral approach remains relevant where one treaty partner has not signed the MLI, where jurisdictions prefer customised terms, or where diplomatic relationships favour traditional negotiation. In practice, most STTR implementation will occur through the MLI, with bilateral amendments filling gaps for specific treaty relationships.

## The STTR Multilateral Convention (STTR MLI)

### Purpose

The STTR MLI enables jurisdictions to **swiftly implement** the STTR into multiple bilateral tax treaties without individual renegotiation. It operates similarly to the BEPS MLI but is specifically designed for the STTR provision.

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Scope** | Modifies bilateral tax treaties to include STTR |
| **No reservations** | Uniform application required (no opt-outs) |
| **Covered Tax Agreements** | Only applies to treaties notified by both parties |
| **Depositary** | OECD Secretary-General |
| **Languages** | English and French (equally authentic) |

### How the STTR MLI Works

```
STTR MLI MECHANISM

Step 1: SIGNATURE
        → Jurisdiction signs the STTR MLI
        → Submits initial notifications to OECD

Step 2: NOTIFICATION OF COVERED TAX AGREEMENTS
        → Jurisdiction lists bilateral treaties to be covered
        → Must notify at signature or ratification

Step 3: RATIFICATION
        → Complete domestic approval processes
        → Deposit instrument of ratification with OECD

Step 4: ENTRY INTO FORCE (for the jurisdiction)
        → First day of month following 3 months after deposit

Step 5: MATCHING
        → Both parties to a bilateral treaty must have:
          (a) Signed and ratified STTR MLI
          (b) Notified that treaty as a Covered Tax Agreement
        → Treaty becomes a "Covered Tax Agreement" (CTA)

Step 6: ENTRY INTO EFFECT (for the CTA)
        → STTR provisions apply from specified date
        → Generally: 6 months after latest entry into force
```

### Covered Tax Agreements (CTAs)

A bilateral tax treaty becomes a **Covered Tax Agreement** when:

1. **Both** contracting jurisdictions have signed the STTR MLI
2. **Both** have notified that treaty as covered
3. **Both** have deposited instruments of ratification

```
COVERED TAX AGREEMENT EXAMPLE

Treaty: Germany - Indonesia

Germany:
□ Signed STTR MLI?                    → Pending (intent expressed)
□ Notified Germany-Indonesia treaty?  → TBD
□ Ratified?                           → TBD

Indonesia:
□ Signed STTR MLI?                    → Yes (19 Sept 2024)
□ Notified Germany-Indonesia treaty?  → Yes (included in 29 treaties)
□ Ratified?                           → Pending

Result: NOT YET a Covered Tax Agreement
        (requires Germany to also sign, notify, and ratify)
```

## Signing and Ratification Status

### September 2024 Signing Ceremony

On **19 September 2024**, the OECD held the first formal signing ceremony for the STTR MLI.

#### Jurisdictions That Signed (9)

| Jurisdiction | Region | Treaties Notified |
|--------------|--------|-------------------|
| Barbados | Caribbean | 6 |
| Belize | Central America | 2 |
| Benin | West Africa | 2 |
| Cabo Verde | West Africa | 8 |
| Democratic Republic of the Congo | Central Africa | 5 |
| Indonesia | Southeast Asia | 29 |
| Romania | Europe | 23 |
| San Marino | Europe | 6 |
| Türkiye | Europe/Asia | 33 |

#### Jurisdictions Expressing Intent to Sign (10)

| Jurisdiction | Region |
|--------------|--------|
| Belgium | Europe |
| Bulgaria | Europe |
| Costa Rica | Central America |
| Mongolia | Asia |
| Portugal | Europe |
| Senegal | West Africa |
| Seychelles | Africa |
| Thailand | Southeast Asia |
| Ukraine | Europe |
| Uzbekistan | Central Asia |

#### Statement of Support (24 jurisdictions)

Twenty-four jurisdictions not in scope of the STTR commitment signed a **statement of support**, signalling political endorsement without becoming parties.

The September 2024 signing ceremony revealed important patterns about STTR implementation. The initial signatories were predominantly developing countries—precisely those jurisdictions the STTR was designed to benefit. Notable absences included major developed country source jurisdictions like Germany, the UK, and the United States. This distribution reflects the STTR's targeting: developed countries with high corporate tax rates have limited motivation to sign, since the STTR primarily affects their outbound payments to low-tax jurisdictions rather than their domestic revenue. The European signatories (Romania, Türkiye) represent exceptions with specific policy interests in source taxation. The pace of additional signatures will determine how quickly the STTR network expands.

### Ratification Progress

As of early 2025:
- **Signed:** 9 jurisdictions
- **Ratified:** Pending (no deposits yet)
- **Entry into force:** Not yet achieved (requires 2 ratifications)

## Entry into Force and Effect

### Entry into Force Timeline

```
STTR MLI ENTRY INTO FORCE TIMELINE

                    Signing        Ratification      Entry into Force
                    │              │                 │
Jurisdiction A      ●──────────────●─────────────────●
                                   │                 ↓
                                   │        3 months after 2nd deposit
                                   │                 │
Jurisdiction B      ●──────────────●─────────────────●
                                   │
                                   ↓
                              2nd deposit
                              triggers entry
                              into force

TIMELINE EXAMPLE:

Jan 2025: Jurisdiction A deposits ratification instrument
Apr 2025: Jurisdiction B deposits ratification instrument
          → Entry into force: 1 August 2025 (first day of month
            following 3 months after 2nd deposit)
```

### Entry into Effect for Treaties

Once the STTR MLI enters into force, the STTR provisions take effect for specific treaties according to the following rules:

```
ENTRY INTO EFFECT FORMULA

For taxes imposed on or after:
First day of fiscal year beginning ≥ 6 months after
the LATEST date on which STTR MLI enters into force
for BOTH parties to the treaty

EXAMPLE:

Treaty: Indonesia - Türkiye

Assume:
• STTR MLI enters into force for Indonesia: 1 August 2025
• STTR MLI enters into force for Türkiye: 1 November 2025
• Latest date: 1 November 2025
• 6 months later: 1 May 2026

First fiscal year beginning on or after 1 May 2026:
• Calendar year taxpayers: FY starting 1 January 2027
• Non-calendar year (e.g., 1 July): FY starting 1 July 2026
```

### Earliest Possible Effect

| Scenario | Earliest STTR Effect |
|----------|---------------------|
| Both ratify Q1 2025 | FY beginning 1 January 2026 |
| Both ratify Q3 2025 | FY beginning 1 January 2027 |
| Both ratify Q1 2026 | FY beginning 1 January 2027 |

## The STTR Commitment

### Who Is Required to Implement STTR?

Members of the Inclusive Framework that apply **nominal corporate income tax rates below 9%** to STTR-covered income have committed to implement the STTR when requested by developing country members.

```
STTR COMMITMENT

LOW-TAX JURISDICTIONS (Rate < 9% on covered income):
• Committed to implement STTR in treaties with developing countries
• Must respond to requests within reasonable timeframe
• Implementation via STTR MLI or bilateral negotiation

Examples of jurisdictions with < 9% rates on certain income:
├── Luxembourg (IP box: ~5%)
├── Netherlands (Innovation box: 9%)
├── Switzerland (Patent box: varies)
├── Singapore (Pioneer status: 0%)
├── Ireland (IP regime: 6.25% historical)
└── Various offshore centres

DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (GNI ≤ $12,535):
• Can REQUEST STTR inclusion in treaties
• Over 70 IF members eligible
• Based on World Bank GNI per capita (2019-2022)
```

### Developing Country Eligibility

A jurisdiction qualifies as a **developing country** for STTR purposes if its Gross National Income (GNI) per capita (World Bank Atlas method) was **USD 12,535 or less** in any of the years 2019-2022.

| Category | GNI per Capita | STTR Eligibility |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Low income | ≤ $1,135 | Eligible |
| Lower-middle income | $1,136 - $4,465 | Eligible |
| Upper-middle income | $4,466 - $12,535 | Eligible |
| High income | > $12,535 | **Not eligible** |

**Note:** Over **70 Inclusive Framework members** qualify as developing countries for this purpose.

The developing country eligibility criteria embed an important limitation: the STTR commitment only requires low-tax jurisdictions to implement the rule when requested by qualifying developing countries. High-income jurisdictions cannot compel STTR inclusion in their treaties, even if they would benefit from additional source taxation rights. This asymmetry reflects the STTR's origin as a concession to developing country concerns about the GloBE Rules' residence-country bias. In practical terms, MNE groups with payment flows exclusively among high-income jurisdictions may never encounter STTR obligations, regardless of how low recipient jurisdiction tax rates fall.

## Bilateral Treaty Modification

### When Bilateral Approach Is Used

Some jurisdictions may choose bilateral treaty amendments instead of (or in addition to) the STTR MLI:

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Non-IF member** | Treaty partner not in Inclusive Framework |
| **Customisation** | Desire for country-specific terms |
| **Timing** | Faster than waiting for both MLI ratifications |
| **Policy choice** | Preference for traditional treaty process |

### Bilateral Amendment Process

```
BILATERAL STTR AMENDMENT PROCESS

Step 1: INITIATION
        → Developing country requests STTR inclusion
        → Low-tax jurisdiction obligated to engage

Step 2: NEGOTIATION
        → Agree on STTR article text
        → Generally follows OECD model provision
        → May include country-specific variations

Step 3: SIGNATURE
        → Protocol or amending agreement signed
        → Exchange of diplomatic notes

Step 4: DOMESTIC APPROVAL
        → Each jurisdiction completes ratification
        → May require parliamentary approval

Step 5: ENTRY INTO FORCE
        → Exchange of ratification instruments
        → Treaty amendment takes effect

TIMELINE: Typically 2-5 years for bilateral amendments
```

### Comparison: MLI vs Bilateral

| Aspect | STTR MLI | Bilateral Amendment |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| **Speed** | Faster (multiple treaties at once) | Slower (one treaty at a time) |
| **Flexibility** | Limited (no reservations) | High (customisable) |
| **Resources** | Lower (standardised process) | Higher (individual negotiations) |
| **Consistency** | Uniform terms | May vary between treaties |
| **Certainty** | Clear rules | Negotiated outcomes |

## Practical Implications for MNEs

### Monitoring Requirements

MNEs with cross-border payments must monitor STTR implementation:

```
STTR MONITORING CHECKLIST

□ Identify all intercompany payments potentially subject to STTR
  → Interest, royalties, service fees, rental, distribution rights

□ Map treaty relationships
  → Source jurisdiction → Recipient jurisdiction
  → Identify applicable bilateral tax treaty

□ Track STTR MLI status for relevant jurisdictions
  → Signed?
  → Ratified?
  → Entry into force date?

□ Track bilateral amendments
  → Any treaty-specific STTR amendments?

□ Determine Covered Tax Agreement status
  → Both parties signed/ratified MLI?
  → Both parties notified the treaty?

□ Calculate entry into effect date
  → 6 months after latest entry into force
  → First fiscal year affected
```

### Stratos STTR Monitoring Example

**Stratos's Treaty Relationships for STTR Purposes:**

| Payer | Recipient | Treaty | STTR MLI Status | CTA Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| Germany | Singapore | DE-SG | Germany: Not signed; Singapore: Not signed | Not CTA |
| Ireland | Luxembourg | IE-LU | Ireland: Not signed; Luxembourg: Not signed | Not CTA |
| UK | Singapore | UK-SG | UK: Not signed; Singapore: Not signed | Not CTA |

**Current Position (2025):** None of Stratos's relevant treaties are currently covered by the STTR MLI, as the major European jurisdictions (Germany, Ireland, UK, Luxembourg) have not signed.

**Monitoring Action:** Track if these jurisdictions sign the STTR MLI or negotiate bilateral amendments with developing country treaty partners.

## 6. Stratos Worked Example: STTR Implementation Monitoring

### 6.1 Background

Stratos Holdings plc monitors STTR implementation for its intercompany payment flows.

### Step 1: Identify Relevant Treaty Relationships

| Payment Flow | Treaty Required | Developing Country? |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Germany → Singapore | DE-SG | Singapore: No (high income) |
| Ireland → Luxembourg | IE-LU | Luxembourg: No (high income) |
| UK → Singapore | UK-SG | Singapore: No (high income) |
| Germany → Indonesia (JV) | DE-ID | Indonesia: **Yes** |

**Key Finding:** Indonesia qualifies as a developing country and has signed the STTR MLI. Germany has not yet signed.

### Step 2: Track MLI Status

| Jurisdiction | Signed | Ratified | EIF Date | Treaties Notified |
|--------------|--------|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Indonesia | ✓ (Sept 2024) | Pending | TBD | 29 (including DE-ID) |
| Germany | Pending | — | — | — |
| Singapore | Not signed | — | — | — |
| Ireland | Not signed | — | — | — |
| Luxembourg | Not signed | — | — | — |
| UK | Not signed | — | — | — |

### Step 3: Assess STTR Exposure

**Current Exposure:** Limited

| Treaty | CTA Status | STTR Applies? |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| DE-SG | Not CTA | **No** (Singapore not developing country) |
| IE-LU | Not CTA | **No** (Luxembourg not developing country) |
| UK-SG | Not CTA | **No** (Singapore not developing country) |
| DE-ID | Partial (ID signed, DE not) | **Not yet** (requires DE to sign) |

**Future Exposure:** If Germany signs and ratifies, payments to Indonesia JV entities could be subject to STTR.

### Step 4: Monitoring Actions

```
STRATOS STTR MONITORING ACTIONS

Immediate (2025):
□ Track Germany STTR MLI signing status
□ Monitor Indonesia ratification
□ Assess TechStart JV payment flows to Indonesia

If Germany signs:
□ Confirm DE-ID treaty notified as CTA
□ Calculate entry into effect date
□ Quantify potential STTR exposure on JV payments

Ongoing:
□ Monitor Singapore/Luxembourg for STTR regime changes
□ Track bilateral STTR negotiations
□ Review payment structures for STTR optimisation
```

## 7. Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Assuming STTR Applies Immediately

**Error:** Assuming STTR applies as soon as jurisdictions sign the MLI.

**Correct approach:** STTR only applies after:
1. Both parties ratify
2. MLI enters into force for both
3. 6-month waiting period passes
4. Fiscal year begins after that date

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring Developing Country Requirement

**Error:** Expecting STTR to apply to all low-tax recipient jurisdictions.

**Correct approach:** The STTR commitment only requires implementation in treaties with **developing country** IF members (GNI ≤ $12,535). High-income jurisdictions like Singapore or Luxembourg are not eligible to request STTR.

### 7.3 Pitfall 3: Overlooking Bilateral Amendments

**Error:** Only monitoring the STTR MLI and missing bilateral treaty amendments.

**Correct approach:** Some jurisdictions may implement STTR through bilateral protocols. Monitor both MLI status and individual treaty amendments.

### Pitfall 4: Misidentifying Covered Tax Agreements

**Error:** Assuming a treaty is covered if one party has signed the MLI.

**Correct approach:** A treaty is only a CTA if **both** parties have signed, ratified, **and** notified that specific treaty. Check both sides.

### Pitfall 5: Not Updating Monitoring

**Error:** Conducting STTR assessment once and not updating.

**Correct approach:** STTR implementation is evolving. Establish regular monitoring (quarterly) of OECD depositary updates.

## Concluding Discussion

STTR implementation represents an evolving landscape that will develop gradually over the coming years. Unlike the GloBE Rules, which many jurisdictions implemented simultaneously for fiscal years beginning in 2024, the STTR's treaty-based nature means its network will expand incrementally as jurisdictions sign, ratify, and complete the domestic processes necessary for entry into force. This phased implementation provides MNE groups with time to prepare but also creates uncertainty about which bilateral relationships will ultimately be affected.

The current signatory list—dominated by developing countries—reveals the STTR's political foundations. Developed countries serving primarily as source jurisdictions have less incentive to participate, since the rule primarily benefits developing country sources at the expense of MNE compliance burden. The major European economies, including Germany, the UK, and France, have not signed the STTR MLI, limiting its immediate practical impact on many MNE groups with European operations. However, this calculus may shift as political pressure mounts and as MNE groups begin channelling payments through structures designed to minimise STTR exposure.

For practitioners, the key discipline is monitoring. The STTR landscape will change as additional jurisdictions sign and ratify, as treaties become Covered Tax Agreements, and as entry-into-effect dates approach. Establishing systematic tracking processes—monitoring OECD depositary updates, tracking bilateral amendment negotiations, and maintaining current status assessments for relevant treaty relationships—enables groups to anticipate STTR obligations before they materialise. The cost of being surprised by an unexpected STTR liability significantly exceeds the investment in proactive monitoring.

# Chapter 8.3: Inclusive Framework Structure

## Learning Objective

After completing this chapter, you will be able to describe the governance structure of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS, understand how Administrative Guidance is developed and issued, navigate the peer review process for qualified status determinations, and identify official resources for staying current with Pillar Two developments.

## Introduction

The Inclusive Framework represents an unprecedented experiment in global tax governance. For the first time, tax rules affecting multinational enterprises worldwide are being developed through a process where developing countries participate on equal footing with traditional OECD members. This inclusive approach shapes not only the substance of Pillar Two rules but also the processes by which those rules evolve—through Administrative Guidance, peer review, and ongoing interpretation.

For practitioners, understanding the Inclusive Framework matters beyond mere institutional awareness. The IF produces the authoritative interpretations that determine how GloBE Rules apply in practice. Administrative Guidance releases can resolve ambiguities in the Model Rules, introduce new compliance requirements, or provide relief from unexpected rule interactions. The peer review process determines which jurisdictions' legislation qualifies for preferential treatment under the ordering rules. Staying current with IF developments is not optional for competent Pillar Two compliance.

The Inclusive Framework's structure also reveals Pillar Two's political dimensions. The consensus-based approach, while ensuring broad buy-in, can slow guidance development as diverse member interests must be reconciled. The peer review mechanism creates incentives for jurisdictions to implement rules consistently, while the switch-off mechanism provides enforcement teeth. Understanding these dynamics helps practitioners anticipate how the framework will evolve and where interpretive flexibility exists.

The **OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS** is the global body responsible for developing, implementing, and monitoring the Two-Pillar Solution to address tax challenges arising from digitalisation.

### Key Bodies Explained

| Body | Role | Relevance to Pillar Two |
|------|------|------------------------|
| **Committee on Fiscal Affairs** | Sets overall tax policy direction | Approves Pillar Two documents |
| **Inclusive Framework Plenary** | Decision-making for BEPS matters | Adopts Model Rules, Guidance |
| **Working Party No. 11** | Technical work on aggressive tax planning | Develops Pillar Two technical guidance |
| **CTPA Secretariat** | Administrative support | Drafts documents, manages processes |
| **Task Force on the Digital Economy** | Pillar One/Two coordination | Oversees implementation |

The governance structure reflects a deliberate balance between efficiency and inclusivity. Technical work flows through Working Parties staffed by subject matter experts, allowing detailed issues to receive sustained attention. The Inclusive Framework plenary serves as the decision-making body where consensus is sought, ensuring all member jurisdictions have voice in final outcomes. The CTPA Secretariat provides continuity and institutional memory, drafting documents and managing processes while member delegates rotate. This structure enables reasonably rapid guidance development—Administrative Guidance releases have emerged roughly quarterly—while maintaining the broad-based legitimacy that political buy-in requires.

### Membership Composition

The Inclusive Framework includes:

```
INCLUSIVE FRAMEWORK MEMBERSHIP (145+ jurisdictions)

By Category:
├── OECD Members (38 jurisdictions)
├── G20 Non-OECD Members (e.g., China, India, Brazil)
└── Other Jurisdictions (~100+ developing countries)

By Region:
├── Europe: ~45 jurisdictions
├── Asia-Pacific: ~35 jurisdictions
├── Americas: ~30 jurisdictions
├── Africa: ~25 jurisdictions
└── Middle East: ~10 jurisdictions

Participation:
• All members participate on EQUAL FOOTING
• Full access to decision-making plenary
• Participation in technical working groups
• Right to request guidance clarifications
```

## Administrative Guidance Process

### How Guidance Is Developed

Administrative Guidance addresses technical questions and provides clarifications on the application of the GloBE Rules.

```
ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDANCE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

Step 1: ISSUE IDENTIFICATION
        ├── Member jurisdiction raises question
        ├── Stakeholder consultation identifies gap
        └── Implementation experience reveals need

Step 2: TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
        ├── Working Party 11 reviews issue
        ├── CTPA Secretariat drafts proposed guidance
        └── Technical experts consulted

Step 3: MEMBER CONSULTATION
        ├── Draft circulated to IF members
        ├── Written comments invited
        └── Technical meetings held

Step 4: CONSENSUS BUILDING
        ├── Comments reviewed and addressed
        ├── Revised draft prepared
        └── Consensus sought among members

Step 5: ADOPTION
        ├── Inclusive Framework plenary approval
        └── Publication on OECD website

Step 6: INTEGRATION
        └── Consolidated Commentary updated
```

### Administrative Guidance Releases

| Release | Date | Key Topics |
|---------|------|------------|
| **AG1** | February 2023 | Currency, transitional rules, safe harbours |
| **AG2** | July 2023 | QDMTT Safe Harbour, GIR simplifications |
| **AG3** | December 2023 | Simplified Calculations framework, DTA issues |
| **AG4** | June 2024 | Allocation rules, STTR interaction |
| **AG5** | January 2025 | Central Record, Article 9.1 clarifications |

The frequency and substance of Administrative Guidance releases underscore that Pillar Two remains a work in progress. Each guidance document has addressed issues that emerged from implementation experience—questions that were not apparent when the Model Rules were drafted but became critical as jurisdictions enacted legislation and MNE groups began compliance. This pattern will likely continue: as more jurisdictions implement rules and the first GIR filings occur, new interpretive questions will surface requiring IF resolution. Practitioners must treat the guidance documents as living authorities that will evolve, not as static interpretive aids.

### Binding Effect of Guidance

```
LEGAL STATUS OF ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDANCE

Administrative Guidance is:
✓ Agreed by Inclusive Framework members
✓ Incorporated into Consolidated Commentary
✓ Expected to be followed by implementing jurisdictions
✓ Basis for peer review assessments

Administrative Guidance is NOT:
✗ Legally binding on domestic courts
✗ Self-executing (requires domestic implementation)
✗ Retroactive (unless explicitly stated)
✗ Final (subject to update)

PRACTICAL EFFECT:
• Jurisdictions expected to implement consistently
• MNEs should follow for compliance planning
• Deviation may trigger peer review concerns
• Courts may consider as interpretive aid
```

## 5. Peer Review Process

### Overview

The Inclusive Framework conducts **peer reviews** to ensure consistent implementation of GloBE Rules across jurisdictions.

```
PEER REVIEW FRAMEWORK

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PEER REVIEW COMPONENTS                                              │
│                                                                     │
│ 1. TRANSITIONAL QUALIFICATION MECHANISM                             │
│    → Simplified self-certification process                          │
│    → For early implementers (2024-2025)                            │
│    → Leads to "Transitional Qualified Status"                       │
│                                                                     │
│ 2. FULL LEGISLATIVE REVIEW                                          │
│    → Comprehensive assessment                                       │
│    → Detailed examination of legislation                            │
│    → Leads to "Full Qualified Status"                               │
│                                                                     │
│ 3. ONGOING MONITORING                                               │
│    → Continuous review of application                               │
│    → Ensures consistent outcomes                                    │
│    → May result in status change                                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Transitional Qualification Mechanism

For the initial implementation period, the IF uses a streamlined process:

```
TRANSITIONAL QUALIFICATION PROCESS

Step 1: SELF-CERTIFICATION
        └── Jurisdiction certifies legislation aligns with GloBE Rules

Step 2: NOTIFICATION
        └── Information on key features shared with IF members

Step 3: MEMBER REVIEW
        └── 60-day period for IF members to raise questions

Step 4: RESOLUTION
        ├── If no questions: Status granted
        └── If questions: Discussion and resolution

Step 5: DETERMINATION
        ├── Resolved: Transitional Qualified Status
        └── Unresolved: Consensus-minus-one denial

Step 6: PUBLICATION
        └── Listed on Central Record
```

### Central Record of Qualified Status

The OECD maintains a **Central Record** listing jurisdictions with qualified status:

| Status Type | Meaning | Listed Jurisdictions (Jan 2025) |
|-------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| **IIR Transitional Qualified** | IIR legislation meets GloBE standards | 27 jurisdictions |
| **QDMTT Safe Harbour** | QDMTT qualifies for Safe Harbour | 28 jurisdictions |
| **UTPR Qualified** | UTPR legislation meets standards | TBD |

The peer review process embodies the Inclusive Framework's commitment to consistent global implementation. Without qualified status determinations, each jurisdiction could claim its legislation complies with GloBE Rules while introducing variations that undermine the system's coherence. The transitional qualification mechanism—allowing jurisdictions to self-certify subject to member challenge—provides a pragmatic balance between speed and rigour during initial implementation. As the system matures, more comprehensive legislative reviews will likely become the norm, and the IF may tighten standards as experience reveals which variations are acceptable and which create material distortions.

### Importance of Qualified Status

```
WHY QUALIFIED STATUS MATTERS

For IIR:
├── Qualified IIR has priority in collection
├── Non-qualified IIR may be "switched off"
└── Affects ordering rules between jurisdictions

For QDMTT:
├── Qualified QDMTT reduces GloBE liability to zero
├── QDMTT Safe Harbour eliminates residual IIR
└── Non-qualified QDMTT doesn't prevent Top-Up Tax

For MNEs:
├── Know which jurisdictions' rules take precedence
├── Understand where QDMTT eliminates IIR
└── Plan for potential future status changes
```

### Switch-Off Mechanism

If a jurisdiction's legislation loses qualified status:

```
SWITCH-OFF MECHANISM

Trigger:
• Peer review identifies non-compliance
• Legislation amended inconsistently
• Administration fails to apply correctly

Process:
1. IF identifies concern
2. Jurisdiction given opportunity to remedy
3. If unresolved, IF may determine:
   → IIR: "Switched off" for other jurisdictions
   → QDMTT: Loses Safe Harbour status

Effect:
• Other jurisdictions' rules take priority
• MNEs may face additional Top-Up Tax
• Jurisdiction loses revenue to other countries
```

```
STRATOS QUALIFIED STATUS IMPLICATIONS

IIR Ordering:
• UK IIR is qualified → Takes priority for UK-owned subsidiaries
• Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg also qualified
• No conflicts in IIR application

QDMTT Safe Harbour:
• Ireland QDMTT: Qualified for Safe Harbour
  → No residual IIR to UK for Irish Top-Up Tax
  → Stratos pays €426,394 QDMTT to Ireland only

• Germany, Luxembourg: Also qualified
  → QDMTT applies locally if needed
  → No Top-Up Tax due (ETR ≥ 15%)

Non-Qualified Jurisdictions:
• Singapore, USA, Cayman: No GloBE legislation
  → Subject to UK IIR on undertaxed profits
  → Singapore: €197,498 IIR to UK
  → Cayman: €280,480 IIR to UK

Monitoring Action:
□ Track Singapore/Cayman for potential QDMTT adoption
□ Monitor for any status changes in current jurisdictions
```

## 7. Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Assuming All OECD Guidance Is Binding

**Error:** Treating Administrative Guidance as immediately binding domestic law.

**Correct approach:** Administrative Guidance is agreed by the IF and expected to be followed, but it requires domestic implementation. Courts are not bound by it, though they may consider it persuasive.

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring Peer Review Updates

**Error:** Not monitoring Central Record updates for qualified status changes.

**Correct approach:** Qualified status can change. Monitor OECD publications for updates to the Central Record, especially after IF plenary meetings.

### Pitfall 3: Relying on Outdated Guidance

**Error:** Using superseded guidance documents.

**Correct approach:** Always check the Consolidated Commentary (updated with each AG release) for the most current position. Earlier AG documents remain valid but should be read with later updates.

### Pitfall 4: Missing Guidance Releases

**Error:** Not being aware of new Administrative Guidance for months after release.

**Correct approach:** Subscribe to OECD tax alerts, monitor professional publications, and establish internal processes to review new guidance promptly.

### Pitfall 5: Overlooking Stakeholder Input Opportunities

**Error:** Not participating in public consultations on proposed guidance.

**Correct approach:** The OECD often consults stakeholders before finalising guidance. MNEs can submit comments through industry associations or directly.

## Concluding Discussion

The Inclusive Framework represents both the governance mechanism for Pillar Two and an ongoing experiment in multilateral tax coordination. Its success will ultimately be measured not by the sophistication of the rules it produces but by whether 145+ jurisdictions implement those rules consistently enough that the global minimum tax achieves its objectives. The peer review process, the qualified status determinations, and the switch-off mechanism all serve this consistency objective—creating incentives for jurisdictions to follow agreed rules and consequences for those that deviate.

For practitioners, the Inclusive Framework is the authoritative source for Pillar Two interpretation. Domestic legislation may implement the GloBE Rules, but questions about how those rules apply are resolved through IF guidance. Administrative Guidance releases carry practical authority regardless of their formal legal status—jurisdictions that ignore them risk losing qualified status, and MNE groups that disregard them risk challenges from tax authorities. Building monitoring processes to track IF developments is as essential as tracking domestic legislation changes.

The Inclusive Framework's future evolution bears watching. As implementation experience accumulates, pressure will build to address gaps and inconsistencies in the current rules. The balance between simplification and precision will continue to shift as stakeholders advocate for both more detailed guidance and more practical safe harbours. The peer review process may become more rigorous as the IF develops capacity for comprehensive legislative assessment. Practitioners who understand the IF's structure and processes can better anticipate where the rules are heading and position their organisations accordingly.

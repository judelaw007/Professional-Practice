Pillar Two is a **living framework**. The GloBE Rules are supplemented by regular Administrative Guidance that clarifies, simplifies, and addresses implementation issues.

### Why Tracking Matters

| Risk | Consequence |
|------|-------------|
| **Missing new guidance** | Non-compliant calculations, incorrect elections |

```
GUIDANCE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS

```

### Prioritisation Framework

Not all guidance requires immediate action. Prioritise based on:

| Priority | Criteria | Timeline |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Critical** | Changes calculation methodology; affects current filings | Immediate |
| **High** | New elections available; affects compliance process | 1-2 months |
| **Medium** | Clarifications on existing rules; confirms current approach | 2-3 months |
| **Low** | Future-dated changes; affects limited scenarios | Next annual review |

### Example: Assessing AG5 (January 2025)

```
AG5 IMPACT ASSESSMENT EXAMPLE

Topic 1: Central Record of Qualified Status
├── Priority: HIGH
├── Impact: Confirms qualified status of operating jurisdictions
├── Action: Verify group jurisdictions on list
└── Timeline: Immediate

Topic 2: Article 9.1 DTA Guidance
├── Priority: MEDIUM (unless significant DTAs)
├── Impact: Clarifies treatment of DTAs from government benefits
├── Action: Review opening DTA positions
└── Timeline: Before next filing

Topic 3: Updated GIR and XML Schema
├── Priority: HIGH
├── Impact: Filing format changes
├── Action: Update GIR preparation systems
└── Timeline: Before next GIR filing

Topic 4: GIR MCAA Framework
├── Priority: MEDIUM
├── Impact: Exchange of information procedures
├── Action: Confirm DFE jurisdiction has signed MCAA
└── Timeline: Before filing deadline
```

## Consolidated Commentary

### What Is the Consolidated Commentary?

The OECD periodically publishes a **Consolidated Commentary** that integrates:
- Original Commentary (March 2022)
- All Administrative Guidance releases
- Updated examples and clarifications

```
CONSOLIDATED COMMENTARY STRUCTURE

The Consolidated Commentary mirrors Model Rules structure:

Chapter 1: Scope
├── Article 1.1 - 1.5 definitions
└── Scope-related guidance integrated

Chapter 2: Charging Provisions
├── IIR mechanics
├── UTPR mechanics
└── Ordering rules

Chapter 3: GloBE Income
├── Starting point
├── Adjustments
└── Allocations

Chapter 4: Covered Taxes
├── Current taxes
├── Deferred taxes
└── Allocations

Chapter 5: ETR and Top-up Tax
├── ETR calculation
├── SBIE
├── Top-up Tax
└── Safe Harbours

[Continues through all chapters...]

READING THE CONSOLIDATED COMMENTARY:
• Paragraphs numbered continuously
• New guidance clearly marked
• Cross-references to AG releases
• Examples updated with clarifications
```

### Using the Consolidated Commentary

| Use Case | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| **Technical research** | Start with Consolidated Commentary for complete picture |
| **Understanding changes** | Compare to previous version; check AG release notes |
| **Compliance documentation** | Cite specific paragraphs in working papers |
| **Training materials** | Use as authoritative reference |

## Stratos Worked Example: Tracking and Implementing Guidance

### Scenario

Stratos's tax team implements a process for tracking and responding to Administrative Guidance.

### Step 1: Establish Monitoring

```
STRATOS MONITORING SETUP

Automated Alerts:

□ EY Global Tax Alert - Tax Compliance Manager subscribed
□ Google Alert "OECD Pillar Two" - Weekly digest

Calendar Reminders:

□ Monthly: Review Central Record (1st of month)
□ Quarterly: Full guidance review (end of quarter)

Responsibility:
□ Primary: Head of Tax Compliance
□ Backup: Tax Director
□ Escalation: CFO (for material changes)
```

### Step 2: AG5 Impact Assessment

When AG5 was released (January 2025), Stratos assessed:

| Topic | Relevance | Priority | Action |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| Central Record | High (5 jurisdictions) | Critical | Verify status |
| Article 9.1 DTAs | Medium (German DTA) | High | Review position |
| GIR Updates | High (filing due 2026) | High | Update templates |
| GIR MCAA | Medium (UK DFE) | Medium | Confirm UK signed |

### Step 3: Implementation Actions

```

□ Reviewed German Article 9.1 DTA position

Week 3:
□ Updated GIR preparation checklist
□ Confirmed UK has signed GIR MCAA
□ Scheduled system update for GIR XML schema

Week 4:
□ Briefed Audit Committee on AG5 (quarterly update)
□ Updated internal Pillar Two policy document
□ Filed impact assessment in compliance records

Ongoing:
□ Monitor for AG6 release (expected 2025)
□ Track Netherlands implementation of AG5
□ Review Consolidated Commentary when published
```

### Step 4: Document Updates

```

├── Final check of qualified status
├── Verify GIR template is current
└── Brief external auditors

Q4: YEAR-END PLANNING
├── Review any late-year guidance
├── Plan for transition year changes
├── Update next year's compliance calendar
└── Brief Audit Committee on Pillar Two status
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Relying on Outdated Materials

**Error:** Using original Commentary without checking for AG updates.

**Correct approach:** Always use the Consolidated Commentary or verify against latest AG releases. Date-stamp all reference documents.

### Pitfall 2: Delayed Implementation

**Error:** Waiting until filing deadline to review new guidance.

**Correct approach:** Review guidance within 1 week of release. Implement changes within 2-3 months, well before filing.

### Pitfall 3: Missing Qualified Status Changes

**Error:** Not checking Central Record updates between filings.

**Correct approach:** Monitor Central Record monthly. Set alerts for jurisdiction-specific changes.

### Pitfall 4: Inconsistent Group Application

**Error:** Different subsidiaries/regions applying guidance inconsistently.

**Correct approach:** Centralise guidance interpretation. Issue group-wide policy updates. Train all relevant staff.

### Pitfall 5: No Documentation of Guidance Review

**Error:** Reviewing guidance but not documenting the review or decisions made.

**Correct approach:** Maintain a guidance review log. Document impact assessments. Record policy decisions and rationale.

## Overview: QDMTT and Qualified Status

A **Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT)** is a domestic minimum tax that meets specific standards ensuring it produces outcomes consistent with the GloBE Rules.

### Why Qualification Matters

| Scenario | Effect on MNE |
|----------|---------------|
| **Qualified QDMTT + Safe Harbour** | Pay QDMTT locally; no IIR to UPE jurisdiction |
| **Qualified QDMTT, no Safe Harbour** | Pay QDMTT; may have residual IIR if calculations differ |
| **Non-qualified QDMTT** | QDMTT may not reduce IIR; potential double payment risk |
| **No QDMTT** | Full IIR applies; revenue flows to UPE jurisdiction |

---

## The Three Qualification Standards

### Standard 1: Accounting Standard

The Accounting Standard ensures the QDMTT is based on **acceptable financial accounts**.

```
ACCOUNTING STANDARD REQUIREMENTS

The QDMTT must be computed using:

OPTION A: Consolidated Financial Statements
├── Accounts used for UPE's consolidated reporting
├── IFRS, US GAAP, or equivalent standard
└── Subject to external audit

OPTION B: Local Statutory Accounts
├── Required under domestic corporate/tax law
├── Prepared using acceptable accounting standard
└── Subject to external financial audit

OPTION C: Authorised Financial Accounting Standard
├── Elected by MNE Group
├── Listed as acceptable by Inclusive Framework
└── Applied consistently

KEY REQUIREMENT:
Financial accounts must be:
□ Required under domestic law, OR
□ Subject to external financial audit

If neither condition is met:
→ QDMTT may still be "qualified"
→ But QDMTT Safe Harbour does NOT apply
```

### Standard 2: Consistency Standard

The Consistency Standard requires QDMTT computations to **align with GloBE Rules**.

```
CONSISTENCY STANDARD REQUIREMENTS

The QDMTT must produce outcomes consistent with GloBE Rules:

REQUIRED ALIGNMENT:
□ GloBE Income calculation methodology
□ Covered Taxes definition and adjustments
□ ETR calculation formula
□ SBIE computation (transition rates)
□ Top-up Tax calculation
□ Allocation rules

PERMITTED VARIATIONS:
□ Variations explicitly permitted in Commentary
□ Variations approved by Inclusive Framework
□ Local currency instead of EUR

NOT PERMITTED:
✗ Omitting GloBE adjustments
✗ Using different income definitions
✗ Applying different tax base
✗ Excluding certain taxes from Covered Taxes
✗ Modifying SBIE percentages

ASSESSMENT:
• Jurisdictional evaluation (not entity-specific)
• Conducted through peer review
• Switch-off applies if standard not met
```

### Standard 3: Administration Standard

The Administration Standard ensures the QDMTT is **applied consistently in practice**.

```
ADMINISTRATION STANDARD REQUIREMENTS

The jurisdiction must:

APPLY RULES CONSISTENTLY:
□ Tax administration follows GloBE methodology
□ Assessments align with QDMTT legislation
□ Guidance consistent with GloBE Commentary
□ No administrative practices that undermine rules

AVOID PILLAR TWO-RELATED BENEFITS:
□ No tax incentives tied to Pillar Two status
□ No rebates of QDMTT paid
□ No credits that effectively offset QDMTT
□ No rulings that circumvent QDMTT

ONGOING MONITORING:
□ Inclusive Framework monitors administration
□ Issues may trigger review
□ Continued qualification requires compliance
```

### Summary: Three Standards

| Standard | Focus | Key Test |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Accounting** | Financial data source | Acceptable accounts, audited or required by law |
| **Consistency** | Calculation methodology | Aligns with GloBE Rules |
| **Administration** | Practical application | Applied consistently, no circumvention |

## QDMTT Safe Harbour

### What Is the QDMTT Safe Harbour?

The QDMTT Safe Harbour **eliminates residual IIR liability** when a jurisdiction's QDMTT meets all three standards.

```
QDMTT SAFE HARBOUR MECHANISM

WITHOUT SAFE HARBOUR:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Step 1: Calculate QDMTT under local rules                          │
│         → Ireland QDMTT = €428,928                                  │
│                                                                     │
│ Step 2: Calculate GloBE Top-up Tax under GloBE Rules               │
│         → GloBE calculation = €435,000 (methodology differences)    │
│                                                                     │
│ Step 3: IIR = GloBE Top-up Tax − QDMTT paid                        │
│         → €435,000 − €428,928 = €6,072 residual IIR                │
│                                                                     │
│ Result: MNE pays QDMTT (€428,928) + IIR (€6,072) = €435,000        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

WITH SAFE HARBOUR:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Step 1: Calculate QDMTT under local rules                          │
│         → Ireland QDMTT = €428,928                                  │
│                                                                     │
│ Step 2: QDMTT Safe Harbour applies                                  │
│         → GloBE Top-up Tax deemed = €0                              │
│                                                                     │
│ Step 3: IIR = €0                                                    │
│                                                                     │
│ Result: MNE pays QDMTT only (€428,928)                              │
│         No dual calculation required                                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Safe Harbour Requirements

For QDMTT Safe Harbour to apply:

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Qualified QDMTT** | Meets all three standards |
| **Accounting Standard** | Financial accounts audited or required by law |
| **No MNE exclusion** | MNE must actually be subject to the QDMTT |
| **Central Record listing** | Jurisdiction listed on OECD Central Record |

---

## Peer Review Process

### Transitional Qualification Mechanism

For the initial implementation period (2024-2026), the Inclusive Framework uses a **simplified self-certification process**:

```
TRANSITIONAL QUALIFICATION PROCESS

Step 1: SELF-CERTIFICATION
        ├── Jurisdiction confirms legislation meets standards
        ├── Provides key features of QDMTT legislation
        └── Submits to Inclusive Framework

Step 2: CIRCULATION TO MEMBERS
        ├── Information shared with all IF members
        └── 60-day review period

Step 3: MEMBER QUESTIONS
        ├── IF members may raise questions
        ├── Questions must relate to qualified status
        └── Jurisdiction must respond

Step 4: RESOLUTION
        ├── Questions discussed and resolved
        ├── Clarifications provided
        └── Amendments made if necessary

Step 5: DETERMINATION
        ├── If no questions OR questions resolved:
        │   → Transitional Qualified Status GRANTED
        │
        └── If questions unresolved:
            → Consensus-minus-one decision
            → May deny qualified status

Step 6: PUBLICATION
        └── Listed on Central Record
```

### Full Legislative Review

The **full peer review** (to replace transitional mechanism) involves:

```
FULL LEGISLATIVE REVIEW PROCESS

Phase 1: LEGISLATION ASSESSMENT
├── Detailed examination of QDMTT legislation
├── Line-by-line comparison to GloBE Rules
├── Identification of any deviations
└── Assessment against three standards

Phase 2: IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW
├── How legislation is applied in practice
├── Tax administration guidance reviewed
├── Rulings and interpretations examined
└── No Pillar Two-related benefits check

Phase 3: OUTCOME DETERMINATION
├── Full qualified status, OR
├── Qualified with conditions, OR
├── Not qualified

Phase 4: ONGOING MONITORING
├── Continuous assessment of application
├── Review of legislative amendments
└── Status can be changed if issues arise
```

### Switch-Off Rule

If a QDMTT loses qualified status:

```
SWITCH-OFF MECHANISM

TRIGGER:
• Peer review identifies non-compliance
• Legislation amended inconsistently
• Administrative practices undermine QDMTT
• Pillar Two-related benefits provided

PROCESS:
1. IF identifies concern with jurisdiction's QDMTT
2. Jurisdiction notified and given opportunity to remedy
3. If unresolved, IF may determine QDMTT not qualified

EFFECT OF SWITCH-OFF:
├── QDMTT Safe Harbour no longer applies
├── IIR calculations required for that jurisdiction
├── Potential residual IIR payable to UPE jurisdiction
└── Revenue loss for switched-off jurisdiction

NOTE: Switch-off is jurisdictional, not entity-specific
      All MNEs in that jurisdiction affected
```

## Stratos Worked Example: QDMTT Qualification Assessment

### Background

Stratos Holdings plc verifies QDMTT qualified status for its operating jurisdictions.

### Step 1: Identify Jurisdictions with QDMTT

| Jurisdiction | Has QDMTT? | Effective Date |
|--------------|------------|----------------|
| UK | Yes | 1 January 2024 |
| Germany | Yes | 1 January 2024 |
| Ireland | Yes | 1 January 2024 |
| Luxembourg | Yes | 1 January 2024 |
| Singapore | Yes | 1 January 2025 |
| USA | No | — |
| Cayman | No | — |

### Step 2: Verify Three Standards

**Ireland Assessment:**

| Standard | Assessment | Met? |
|----------|------------|------|
| **Accounting** | IFRS required for listed companies; statutory accounts audited | ✓ Yes |
| **Consistency** | Irish QDMTT mirrors GloBE Rules; uses same definitions | ✓ Yes |
| **Administration** | Revenue applies rules consistently; no circumvention benefits | ✓ Yes |

**Result:** Ireland QDMTT qualifies for Safe Harbour

### Step 3: Check Central Record

| Jurisdiction | On Central Record? | Safe Harbour? | Verified Date |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| UK | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes | 15 Jan 2025 |
| Germany | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes | 15 Jan 2025 |
| Ireland | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes | 15 Jan 2025 |
| Luxembourg | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes | 15 Jan 2025 |
| Singapore | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes | 18 Aug 2025 |

### Step 4: Document Compliance Impact

```
STRATOS QDMTT SAFE HARBOUR IMPACT

Jurisdictions with QDMTT Safe Harbour (5):
├── UK: No Top-up Tax (ETR ≥ 15%)
├── Germany: No Top-up Tax (ETR ≥ 15%)
├── Ireland: QDMTT €435,040; IIR = €0
├── Luxembourg: De Minimis applies
└── Singapore: QDMTT replaces IIR from 2025

Jurisdictions without QDMTT (2):
├── USA: No Top-up Tax (ETR 15.49% ≥ 15%)
└── Cayman: IIR €278,110 to UK

FY 2025 IMPACT:
• Ireland: Pay QDMTT locally (€435,040)
           No residual IIR to UK
           Safe Harbour eliminates dual calculation

• Singapore (from 2025):
           Once QDMTT effective, no IIR to UK
           For FY 2024: Still IIR (€184,959)
           For FY 2025+: QDMTT Safe Harbour applies
```

### Step 5: Ongoing Monitoring

```
STRATOS QDMTT MONITORING ACTIONS

Quarterly:
□ Check Central Record for updates
□ Verify continued qualified status
□ Track Singapore QDMTT implementation

Annually:
□ Document qualified status for each jurisdiction
□ Update compliance procedures
□ Brief Audit Committee on any changes

Ad hoc:
□ Monitor IF plenary outcomes
□ Track legislative amendments in operating jurisdictions
□ Review any switch-off announcements
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Assuming All Domestic Minimum Taxes Qualify

**Error:** Treating any domestic minimum tax as a QDMTT.

**Correct approach:** Only taxes that meet all three standards (Accounting, Consistency, Administration) qualify. Verify on Central Record.

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring Accounting Standard for Safe Harbour

**Error:** Assuming QDMTT Safe Harbour applies if QDMTT is qualified.

**Correct approach:** QDMTT Safe Harbour has an additional requirement—financial accounts must be audited or required by law. A QDMTT can be "qualified" but not eligible for Safe Harbour.

### Pitfall 3: Not Monitoring for Switch-Off

**Error:** Assuming qualified status is permanent.

**Correct approach:** Qualified status can be withdrawn if a jurisdiction's QDMTT is amended inconsistently or administered improperly. Monitor Central Record updates.

### Pitfall 4: Overlooking Effective Dates

**Error:** Applying QDMTT Safe Harbour before the jurisdiction's QDMTT is effective.

**Correct approach:** Check the effective date on the Central Record. Singapore QDMTT, for example, is effective from 1 January 2025, not 2024.

### Pitfall 5: Forgetting Elective QDMTT Limitations

**Error:** Claiming Safe Harbour when not subject to an elective QDMTT.

**Correct approach:** If a jurisdiction's QDMTT is elective for a transition year, MNEs can only claim Safe Harbour if they are actually subject to that QDMTT.

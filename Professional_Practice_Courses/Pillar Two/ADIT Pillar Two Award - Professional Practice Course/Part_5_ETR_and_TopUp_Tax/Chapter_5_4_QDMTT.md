## 1. What Is QDMTT?

A **Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-Up Tax (QDMTT)** is a domestic tax that a jurisdiction imposes on its own low-taxed entities to bring them up to the 15% minimum rate—before any IIR or UTPR can apply.

### 1.1 The Core Concept

### 1.2 Why Jurisdictions Implement QDMTT

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Preserve taxing rights** | Retain the Top-Up Tax revenue domestically rather than losing it to parent jurisdictions |
| **Simplify compliance** | Single calculation under domestic law rather than multiple GloBE calculations |
| **Protect incentives** | Coordinate with existing tax incentives while meeting minimum tax requirements |
| **Competitive positioning** | Demonstrate commitment to global tax framework while maintaining investment attractiveness |

## 2. QDMTT Priority Rule

QDMTT applies **first** in the rule order:

```
1. QDMTT (source jurisdiction) — Applies first
        ↓
2. IIR (parent jurisdiction) — Applies to remaining Top-Up Tax
        ↓
3. UTPR (sister jurisdictions) — Backstop for uncollected Top-Up Tax
```

### 2.1 Practical Effect

| Scenario | QDMTT | IIR/UTPR |
|----------|-------|----------|
| QDMTT covers 100% of Top-Up Tax | Full liability | €0 |
| QDMTT covers 80% of Top-Up Tax | 80% | 20% |
| No QDMTT in jurisdiction | €0 | Full liability |

### 2.2 Stratos Example: Ireland

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Jurisdictional Top-Up Tax | €426,394 |
| Ireland QDMTT | (€426,394) |
| **IIR Liability (UK)** | **€0** |

Ireland retains the full Top-Up Tax through its QDMTT. No IIR charge to Stratos Holdings plc.

## 3. Qualifying Criteria (Article 10.1)

For a domestic minimum tax to be a "Qualified" DMTT, it must meet three requirements:

### 3.1 Requirement 1: Functional Equivalence

The QDMTT must determine Excess Profits in a manner **equivalent to the GloBE Rules**:

| Element | Must Be Equivalent |
|---------|-------------------|
| GloBE Income calculation | Same adjustments as Articles 3.1-3.5 |
| Covered Taxes calculation | Same as Articles 4.1-4.6 |
| ETR calculation | Same formula as Article 5.1 |
| SBIE calculation | Same payroll/asset carve-outs |
| Excess Profit determination | Same as Article 5.2 |

**Permitted variations:**
- Apply to MNEs below €750M threshold (voluntary extension)
- Apply to purely domestic groups
- Use domestic accounting standards (if consistent outcomes)

### 3.2 Requirement 2: Top-Up to Minimum Rate

The QDMTT must increase domestic tax liability on Excess Profits to the **15% minimum rate**:

```
QDMTT = (15% − Domestic ETR) × Domestic Excess Profits
```

**Key point:** The QDMTT must result in tax **equal to or greater than** what would arise under GloBE Rules. A QDMTT that systematically produces less tax will not qualify.

### 3.3 Requirement 3: Consistent Administration

The QDMTT must be implemented and administered **consistently with GloBE outcomes**:

| Must Avoid | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| **Related benefits** | Tax benefits that offset the QDMTT effect |
| **Systematic shortfalls** | Design features that consistently reduce QDMTT below GloBE amount |
| **Cherry-picking** | Selective application to certain MNEs or income types |

## 4. QDMTT Safe Harbour

The **QDMTT Safe Harbour** is a permanent simplification mechanism introduced in July 2023.

### 4.1 How It Works

When a jurisdiction has QDMTT Safe Harbour status:

1. **Single calculation:** MNE only needs to calculate Top-Up Tax under domestic QDMTT rules
2. **Deemed nil Top-Up Tax:** GloBE Top-Up Tax is deemed to be zero for that jurisdiction
3. **No duplicate computation:** No need to run parallel GloBE calculations

### 4.2 Eligibility for Safe Harbour

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Qualified QDMTT** | Domestic law meets Article 10.1 requirements |
| **Inclusive Framework recognition** | Listed on OECD Central Record |
| **No related benefits** | No tax incentives that reduce QDMTT effectiveness |
| **Transitional or permanent status** | Either transitional qualified status or full peer review |

### 4.3 Benefits of Safe Harbour

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Reduced compliance burden** | One calculation instead of two |
| **Administrative simplicity** | No reconciliation between QDMTT and GloBE calculations |
| **Certainty** | Clear outcome based on domestic rules |

### 5.2 Checking Current Status

**OECD Central Record:** The OECD maintains an updated list of jurisdictions with transitional qualified status for both QDMTT and IIR. Always verify current status before relying on QDMTT offset:

[Central Record of Legislation with Transitional Qualified Status](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/global-minimum-tax/central-record-of-legislation-with-transitional-qualified-status.html)

## 6. Transitional Qualified Status

### 6.1 What Is Transitional Status?

During the initial implementation period, the Inclusive Framework allows **transitional qualified status** for jurisdictions that have enacted QDMTT legislation but have not yet completed full peer review.

### 4.1 How It Works

| Status | Meaning | Duration |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Transitional Qualified** | Self-certified compliance; full peer review pending | Until peer review complete |
| **Fully Qualified** | Peer review completed; confirmed compliance | Permanent |
| **Conditional DMTT** | Applies only when MNE is subject to GloBE elsewhere | 2024 only (must become unconditional) |

### 6.3 Elective DMTT Special Rule

Some jurisdictions implemented **Elective DMTTs** in 2024 (where MNEs could choose whether to apply). These can qualify for transitional status if:

1. The DMTT becomes non-elective in subsequent years
2. MNEs cannot claim Safe Harbour if they elected out

## 7. Stratos QDMTT Analysis

### 7.1 Jurisdiction Assessment

| Jurisdiction | QDMTT Status | Impact on Stratos |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Germany** | ✅ QDMTT | Not applicable (ETR 23% > 15%) |
| **Singapore** | ❌ No QDMTT | Full Top-Up Tax via IIR |
| **Ireland** | ✅ QDMTT (Safe Harbour) | Ireland retains Top-Up Tax |
| **UK** | ✅ QDMTT (Safe Harbour) | Not applicable (parent; high-tax) |

### 7.2 Detailed Analysis: Ireland

**Without QDMTT:**
- Jurisdictional Top-Up Tax: €426,394
- IIR applies: UK collects €426,394

**With QDMTT:**
- Ireland collects QDMTT: €426,394
- IIR liability: €0
- **Revenue stays in Ireland**

### 7.3 Detailed Analysis: Singapore

**Current status:** Singapore has not implemented QDMTT.

**Impact:**
- Jurisdictional Top-Up Tax: €197,498
- No QDMTT offset available
- IIR applies: UK collects €197,498

**Future consideration:** If Singapore implements QDMTT, the Top-Up Tax would be collected in Singapore rather than the UK.

## 8. QDMTT Calculation Mechanics

When applying QDMTT, the source jurisdiction typically follows GloBE-equivalent calculations:

### 8.1 Step 1: Determine Domestic GloBE Income

Using domestic implementation of GloBE Income adjustments (same as Chapter 3).

### 8.2 Step 2: Determine Domestic Covered Taxes

Using domestic implementation of Covered Tax adjustments (same as Chapter 4).

### 8.3 Step 3: Calculate Domestic ETR

```
Domestic ETR = Domestic Covered Taxes ÷ Domestic GloBE Income
```

### 8.4 Step 4: Calculate Domestic SBIE

Using domestic implementation of payroll and tangible asset carve-outs.

### 8.5 Step 5: Calculate QDMTT

```
QDMTT = (15% − Domestic ETR) × (Domestic GloBE Income − Domestic SBIE)
```

### 8.6 Potential Variations

QDMTT calculations may differ slightly from GloBE calculations due to:

| Variation | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Domestic accounting standards** | May produce different GloBE Income |
| **Rounding differences** | Minor computational variations |
| **Local elections** | Different election choices than group-wide |

**Key principle:** Any variation must result in QDMTT **equal to or greater than** GloBE Top-Up Tax. If domestic calculation produces less, the jurisdiction loses qualified status.

## 9. Interaction with IIR and UTPR

### 9.1 Offset Mechanics

| Scenario | QDMTT Effect | IIR/UTPR Amount |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| QDMTT = Full Top-Up Tax | Full offset | €0 |
| QDMTT < Top-Up Tax | Partial offset | Difference |
| QDMTT > Top-Up Tax | Full offset | €0 (excess not refunded) |

### 9.2 Example: Partial QDMTT Coverage

**Hypothetical:** A jurisdiction's QDMTT covers only 80% of the GloBE Top-Up Tax due to calculation differences.

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| GloBE Jurisdictional Top-Up Tax | €100,000 |
| QDMTT Paid | €80,000 |
| **IIR Liability** | **€20,000** |

**Note:** This scenario is rare. Properly designed QDMTTs should cover the full GloBE amount.

## 10. Common Pitfalls

### 10.1 Pitfall 1: Assuming All Domestic Minimum Taxes Are QDMTTs

**Error:** Treating any domestic minimum tax as qualifying for GloBE offset.

**Correct approach:** Verify the jurisdiction is listed on the OECD Central Record with transitional or permanent qualified status.

### 10.2 Pitfall 2: Ignoring Transitional Status Conditions

**Error:** Relying on QDMTT offset without checking if transitional conditions are met.

**Correct approach:** Confirm the jurisdiction's status is current and any conditions (e.g., non-elective requirement) are satisfied.

### 10.3 Pitfall 3: Forgetting Safe Harbour Election

**Error:** Running full GloBE calculations for a QDMTT Safe Harbour jurisdiction.

**Correct approach:** If Safe Harbour applies, deem GloBE Top-Up Tax as zero and rely on domestic QDMTT calculation.

### 10.4 Pitfall 4: Overlooking Related Benefits

**Error:** Assuming QDMTT qualifies when jurisdiction offers offsetting tax benefits.

**Correct approach:** Check for "related benefits" that may disqualify the QDMTT from qualified status.

### 10.5 Pitfall 5: Not Updating Jurisdiction Lists

**Error:** Using outdated information on which jurisdictions have implemented QDMTT.

**Correct approach:** Regularly check the OECD Central Record for updates, especially for new fiscal years.

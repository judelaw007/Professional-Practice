## Model Answers

### Answer 1: Entry Date and Partial-Year Treatment

**Entry Date:** 1 July 2025 (acquisition completion date)

**Days in Group:** 1 July to 31 December = **184 days** (assuming calendar year-end)

**Partial-Year Fraction:** 184/365 = **50.41%**

**Partial-Year Calculation**

| Entity | Entry Date | Days in Group | Full Year Income (€) | Partial Income (€) | Full Year Tax (€) | Partial Tax (€) |
|--------|------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| TechStart Inc. | 1 July 2025 | 184/365 | 18,000,000 | **9,074,000** | 3,780,000 | **1,905,500** |
| TechStart UK Ltd | 1 July 2025 | 184/365 | 6,000,000 | **3,025,000** | 1,500,000 | **756,200** |
| TechStart GmbH | 1 July 2025 | 184/365 | 12,000,000 | **6,049,000** | 2,760,000 | **1,391,300** |
| TechStart IP LLC | 1 July 2025 | 184/365 | 8,000,000 | **4,033,000** | 0 | **0** |
| TechStart Ventures Fund | 1 July 2025 | 184/365 | 4,000,000 | **2,016,000** | 40,000 | **20,200** |

**Note:** Under Article 6.2.1, acquired entities are included from the acquisition date. The partial-year approach allocates income proportionally.

---

### Answer 2: Joint Venture Classification

**JV Classification Checklist**

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Is entity equity-accounted in TechStart's books? | **Yes** — 55% ownership typically equity-accounted |
| Is ownership ≥ 50%? | **Yes** — 55% |
| Is entity itself a UPE of an in-scope MNE? | **No** |
| **Classification** | **Joint Venture** |

**Treatment:** Under Article 6.4.1, TechStart JV Pte Ltd and its subsidiary form a **separate MNE Group** for GloBE purposes. They are **not blended** with the main Stratos Group.

**JV Group ETR Calculation**

| Jurisdiction | JV Entity | GloBE Income (€) | Covered Taxes (€) | ETR |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|-----|
| Singapore | TechStart JV Pte | 10,000,000 | 1,000,000 | **10.00%** |
| Malaysia | JV Operations Sdn | 5,000,000 | 600,000 | **12.00%** |

**Singapore JV SBIE & Top-Up Tax:**
```
SBIE:
Payroll: €2,000,000 × 9% = €180,000
Assets: €1,500,000 × 7% = €105,000
Total SBIE: €285,000

Excess Profit: €10,000,000 − €285,000 = €9,715,000
Top-Up Tax %: 15% − 10% = 5%
Singapore JV Top-Up Tax: €9,715,000 × 5% = €485,750
```

**Malaysia JV SBIE & Top-Up Tax:**
```
SBIE:
Payroll: €1,800,000 × 9% = €162,000
Assets: €2,200,000 × 7% = €154,000
Total SBIE: €316,000

Excess Profit: €5,000,000 − €316,000 = €4,684,000
Top-Up Tax %: 15% − 12% = 3%
Malaysia JV Top-Up Tax: €4,684,000 × 3% = €140,520
```

**Top-Up Tax Allocation**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| JV Group Total Top-Up Tax | **€626,270** |
| Stratos's ownership % (via TechStart Inc.) | **55%** |
| Stratos's allocated share | **€344,449** |

**Note:** Stratos only acquired TechStart on 1 July. For the JV, the full year applies to the JV Group calculation, but Stratos only bears its share from the acquisition date. This is a complexity that requires careful analysis — the conservative approach is to include 55% of the full-year JV Top-Up Tax in Stratos's IIR liability, though partial-year treatment may also apply.

### Answer 3: Flow-Through Entity Analysis

**Flow-Through Analysis**

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is LLC fiscally transparent in US? | **Yes** — single-member LLC disregarded |
| Is LLC the UPE? | **No** — TechStart Inc. is UPE (now Stratos) |
| Who are the owners? | 80% TechStart Inc., 20% External LPs |
| Does income flow to CE-owners? | **Yes** — under Article 3.5.3 |
| **Classification** | **Tax Transparent Entity (TTE)** |

**Income Allocation**

| Owner | Ownership % | Allocated Income (€) | Jurisdiction |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|
| TechStart Inc. | 80% | €4,033,000 × 80% = **€3,226,400** | USA |
| External LPs | 20% | €4,033,000 × 20% = **€806,600** | Outside Group |

**Note:** The 20% held by external LPs is excluded from GloBE calculations as they are not Constituent Entities.

**Combined US ETR Calculation (Partial Year)**

| Item | TechStart Inc. | IP LLC (80% share) | Combined US |
|------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| GloBE Income | €9,074,000 | €3,226,400 | **€12,300,400** |
| Covered Taxes | €1,905,500 | €0 | **€1,905,500** |
| Combined ETR | — | — | **15.49%** |

**Result:** Combined US ETR of 15.49% exceeds 15% minimum rate. **No Top-Up Tax** for US jurisdiction.

### Answer 4: Investment Entity Assessment

**Investment Fund Definition Test**

| Criterion | Meets? | Explanation |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Pools assets from multiple investors | **No** | 100% owned by TechStart Inc. |
| Some investors unrelated | **No** | Single corporate owner |
| Defined investment policy | Yes | Has investment mandate |
| Regulated entity/management | No | Cayman exempt fund, not regulated |
| Managed by professionals | Yes | Professional fund manager |
| **Qualifies as Investment Fund?** | **No** | Fails pooling + regulation tests |

**Treatment Determination**

```
If Investment Fund AND UPE: → Excluded Entity (Art. 1.5.1)
If Investment Fund AND NOT UPE: → Separate ETR (Art. 7.4)
If NOT Investment Fund: → Standard CE treatment ✓

Conclusion: TechStart Ventures Fund is a STANDARD CONSTITUENT ENTITY
            Subject to normal jurisdictional ETR calculation
```

**ETR Calculation (Standard CE — Cayman)**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| GloBE Income (partial year) | **€2,016,000** |
| Covered Taxes (partial year) | **€20,200** |
| ETR | **1.00%** |
| Top-Up Tax % | **14.00%** |

**SBIE Calculation:**
```
Payroll: €200,000 × 50.41% × 9% = €9,074
Assets: €50,000 × 7% = €3,500
Total SBIE: €12,574

Excess Profit: €2,016,000 − €12,574 = €2,003,426
Top-Up Tax: €2,003,426 × 14% = €280,480
```

**Cayman Top-Up Tax:** €280,480

| **UK (Combined)** | 11,525,000 | 25.00% | — | — | **0** | ≥15% |
| **Germany (Combined)** | 59,929,000 | 23.00% | — | — | **0** | ≥15% |
| **USA (Combined)** | 12,300,400 | 15.49% | — | — | **0** | ≥15% |
| **Singapore (Stratos)** | 4,000,000 | 9.81% | 5.19% | 167,500 | **198,907** | No QDMTT |
| **Ireland (Stratos)** | 15,000,000 | 11.80% | 3.20% | 1,596,000 | **428,928** | QDMTT |
| **Cayman (Ventures)** | 2,016,000 | 1.00% | 14.00% | 12,574 | **280,480** | No QDMTT |
| **JV Singapore** | 10,000,000 | 10.00% | 5.00% | 285,000 | **485,750** | Separate (55% = €267,163) |
| **JV Malaysia** | 5,000,000 | 12.00% | 3.00% | 316,000 | **140,520** | Separate (55% = €77,286) |
| **TOTAL** | | | | | **1,534,585** | |

**Stratos's Share of Total Top-Up Tax:**

| Component | Amount (€) |
|-----------|------------|
| Main Group Top-Up Tax | 908,315 |
| JV Allocated Share (55%) | 344,449 |
| **Total Stratos Liability** | **1,252,764** |

**Collection Mechanism Summary**

| Amount (€) | Recipient | Mechanism | Source |
|------------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| 198,907 | UK (Stratos) | IIR | Singapore (Stratos) |
| 280,480 | UK (Stratos) | IIR | Cayman (Ventures) |
| 344,449 | UK (Stratos) | IIR | JV (allocated share) |
| 428,928 | Ireland | QDMTT | Ireland (Stratos) |
| **1,252,764** | **Total** | | |

**Key Observations:**

1. **Acquisition Impact:** TechStart entities only included for 184/365 days (50.41%)

2. **US Jurisdiction Added:** Combined US ETR (TechStart Inc. + IP LLC flow-through) = 15.49%, just above minimum

3. **JV Separate Treatment:** TechStart JV treated as separate MNE Group; Stratos bears 55% of JV Top-Up Tax

4. **Cayman Exposure:** TechStart Ventures Fund (not an Investment Entity) creates €280,480 Top-Up Tax

5. **Ireland QDMTT:** Continues to offset Irish Top-Up Tax

---

## Learning Points

### Point 1: Partial-Year Treatment Reduces Exposure

By acquiring mid-year, Stratos includes only 50.41% of TechStart's results:

| Metric | Full Year | Partial Year | Savings |
|--------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Cayman Top-Up Tax | ~€556,000 | €280,480 | ~€275,520 |

**Timing consideration:** Acquisitions later in the fiscal year reduce first-year GloBE exposure.

### Point 2: JV Treatment Creates Separate Calculation

TechStart JV Pte Ltd cannot be blended with SG Singapore Pte Ltd even though both are in Singapore:

| Entity | Treatment | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| SG Singapore Pte Ltd | Main Group | 100% owned, consolidated |
| TechStart JV Pte Ltd | Separate MNE Group | 55% equity-accounted, JV |

**Result:** Two separate Singapore ETR calculations, potentially with different outcomes.

### Point 3: Flow-Through Allocation Preserves ETR

TechStart IP LLC's income flows to TechStart Inc., achieving combined US ETR of 15.49%:

| Without Flow-through | With Flow-through |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| TechStart Inc.: 21% ETR | Combined: 15.49% ETR |
| IP LLC: 0% ETR (separate) → 15% Top-Up Tax | No separate calculation |

**Key insight:** Flow-through treatment avoided ~€560,000 potential Top-Up Tax on IP LLC.

### Point 4: Investment Entity Definition Is Narrow

TechStart Ventures Fund failed the Investment Fund test because:
- Single corporate owner (no pooling)
- Not regulated

**Result:** Treated as standard CE with 1% ETR → 14% Top-Up Tax.

**Planning opportunity:** If restructured with multiple unrelated investors and proper regulation, might qualify for Investment Entity treatment with potential elections.

### Point 5: Blending Can Improve or Worsen Position

Post-acquisition blending:

| Jurisdiction | Pre-Acquisition ETR | Post-Acquisition ETR | Impact |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| UK | 25.00% | 25.00% | Neutral |
| Germany | 23.00% | 23.00% | Neutral |

In this case, blending was neutral because both groups had similar ETRs. If TechStart entities had lower ETRs, blending could have reduced combined ETR.

## Alternative Scenario: Asset Deal Instead of Share Deal

**Question:** How would the analysis differ if Stratos acquired TechStart's **assets** instead of shares?

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Share Deal (Actual) | Asset Deal (Alternative) |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Entry mechanism** | Entities enter group | Assets transferred to existing/new CEs |
| **Partial-year** | Applies from acquisition date | May apply differently |
| **Basis step-up** | Election under Art. 6.3.4 | Automatic fair value basis |
| **DTL treatment** | Existing DTLs continue | New DTLs based on FV differences |
| **JV treatment** | JV structure preserved | May acquire JV assets directly |
| **Flow-through** | LLC structure preserved | IP assets transferred |

**Asset Deal Consideration:**

Under Article 6.2.2, an asset acquisition may allow:
1. **Immediate basis step-up** to fair value
2. **Fresh start** on deferred tax attributes
3. **Restructuring opportunity** for problematic entities (like Cayman fund)

**Trade-off:** Asset deals often have higher transaction taxes and may not preserve valuable tax attributes.

# Case Study 7: Stratos's First GIR Filing

## Introduction

This case study brings together all concepts from Part 7. You will prepare Stratos Holdings plc's first GloBE Information Return (GIR) for fiscal year 2025, assessing transitional safe harbour eligibility, applying transition year adjustments, completing the GIR data requirements, and establishing the compliance process.

**Important:** This is a comprehensive end-to-end exercise. Work through each task systematically, as later tasks build on earlier results.

**Time estimate:** 120-150 minutes

---

## Background: Stratos's First Pillar Two Compliance Cycle

Stratos Holdings plc is filing its **first GloBE Information Return** for fiscal year ending **31 December 2025**. The UK has implemented qualified IIR legislation effective from 1 January 2024.

### Key Dates

|-----------|------|
| Fiscal year-end | 31 December 2025 |
| First year in scope | FY 2024 |
| Filing year | FY 2025 (second year) |
| Standard GIR deadline | 31 March 2027 (15 months) |
| Transitional deadline | 30 June 2027 (18 months — if applicable) |

### Filing Entity Determination

## Model Answers

### Answer 1: Transitional Safe Harbour Assessment

**The Three Tests:**
1. **De Minimis Test:** Revenue < €10 million AND PBT < €1 million
2. **Simplified ETR Test:** CbCR Tax/CbCR PBT ≥ Transition Rate (16% for FY 2025)
3. **Routine Profits Test:** CbCR PBT ≤ SBIE

**FY 2025 Transition Rate:** 16% (second transition year: 15% → 16% → 17%)

**Safe Harbour Test Results**

| Jurisdiction | Revenue (€) | PBT (€) | De Minimis? | Simplified ETR | Routine Profits? | **Qualifies?** |
|--------------|-------------|---------|-------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| UK | 125,000,000 | 12,000,000 | No | 24.58% ≥ 16% ✓ | No | **Yes (ETR)** |
| Germany | 285,000,000 | 58,000,000 | No | 23.28% ≥ 16% ✓ | No | **Yes (ETR)** |
| Singapore | 45,000,000 | 4,200,000 | No | 9.52% < 16% ✗ | No | **No** |
| Ireland | 95,000,000 | 16,000,000 | No | 11.88% < 16% ✗ | No | **No*** |
| Luxembourg | 8,500,000 | 900,000 | **Yes** ✓ | 25.00% ≥ 16% ✓ | Yes | **Yes (De Minimis)** |
| USA | 78,000,000 | 13,500,000 | No | 21.11% ≥ 16% ✓ | No | **Yes (ETR)** |
| Cayman | 12,000,000 | 2,100,000 | No | 1.00% < 16% ✗ | No | **No** |

*Note: Ireland has QDMTT Safe Harbour instead.

**Simplified ETR Calculation:**
- UK: €2,950,000 / €12,000,000 = 24.58%
- Germany: €13,500,000 / €58,000,000 = 23.28%
- Singapore: €400,000 / €4,200,000 = 9.52%
- Ireland: €1,900,000 / €16,000,000 = 11.88%
- Luxembourg: €225,000 / €900,000 = 25.00%
- USA: €2,850,000 / €13,500,000 = 21.11%
- Cayman: €21,000 / €2,100,000 = 1.00%

**Summary:**
- Jurisdictions qualifying for CbCR Safe Harbour: **UK, Germany, Luxembourg, USA** (4)
- Jurisdictions with QDMTT Safe Harbour: **Ireland** (1)
- Jurisdictions requiring full calculation: **Singapore, Cayman** (2)

### Answer 2: QDMTT Safe Harbour Analysis

**QDMTT Safe Harbour Assessment**

| UK | Yes | Yes (Qualified) | **Yes** | IIR = €0 |
| Germany | Yes | Yes (Qualified) | **Yes** | IIR = €0 |
| Ireland | Yes | Yes (Qualified) | **Yes** | IIR = €0 (QDMTT local) |
| Luxembourg | Yes | Yes (Qualified) | **Yes** | IIR = €0 |

**Combined Safe Harbour Strategy**

| Jurisdiction | CbCR SH? | QDMTT SH? | Full GloBE Calc? | Expected Outcome |
|--------------|----------|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| UK | **Yes** | Yes | **No** | Top-Up Tax = €0 |
| Germany | **Yes** | Yes | **No** | Top-Up Tax = €0 |
| Singapore | No | No | **Yes** | IIR to UK |

| USA | **Yes** | No | **No** | Top-Up Tax = €0 |
| Cayman | No | No | **Yes** | IIR to UK |

**Result:** Only **Singapore and Cayman** require full GloBE calculations.

### Answer 3: Transition Year Adjustments

**DTA Remeasurement (Article 9.1)**

Under Article 9.1.1, deferred tax assets acquired before the transition year are remeasured at the **lower of** the statutory rate or **15%**.

| Jurisdiction | Opening DTA (€) | Original Rate | Underlying Timing Diff (€) | GloBE Value (15%) (€) | Adjustment (€) |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Germany | 3,800,000 | 30% | 12,666,667 | **1,900,000** | (1,900,000) |
| USA | 1,500,000 | 21% | 7,142,857 | **1,071,429** | (428,571) |

**Calculation for Germany:**
- Underlying timing difference: €3,800,000 / 30% = €12,666,667
- GloBE value at 15%: €12,666,667 × 15% = €1,900,000
- Reduction: €3,800,000 − €1,900,000 = €1,900,000

**Calculation for USA:**
- Underlying timing difference: €1,500,000 / 21% = €7,142,857
- GloBE value at 15%: €7,142,857 × 15% = €1,071,429
- Reduction: €1,500,000 − €1,071,429 = €428,571

**Note:** UK (25%) and Ireland (12.5%) — UK DTA already at rate ≥15%; Ireland DTA at rate below 15%, so no cap applies.

**SBIE Calculation (FY 2025 Transition Rates)**

FY 2025 Rates: **Payroll 9.0%** | **Tangible Assets 7.0%**

| Jurisdiction | Eligible Payroll (€) | Payroll SBIE (€) | Tangible Assets (€) | Asset SBIE (€) | Total SBIE (€) |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Singapore | 2,125,000 | **191,250** | 3,500,000 | **245,000** | **436,250** |
| Cayman | 250,000 | **22,500** | 100,000 | **7,000** | **29,500** |

### Answer 4: Top-Up Tax Calculation

**Singapore Full Calculation**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| GloBE Income | **€4,000,000** |
| Covered Taxes | **€392,206** |
| ETR | **9.81%** |
| SBIE | **€436,250** |
| Excess Profit | €4,000,000 − €436,250 = **€3,563,750** |
| Top-Up Tax % | 15% − 9.81% = **5.19%** |
| **Top-Up Tax** | €3,563,750 × 5.19% = **€184,959** |
| Collection mechanism | **IIR to UK** |

**Cayman Full Calculation**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| GloBE Income | **€2,016,000** |
| Covered Taxes | **€20,200** |
| ETR | **1.00%** |
| SBIE | **€29,500** |
| Excess Profit | €2,016,000 − €29,500 = **€1,986,500** |
| Top-Up Tax % | 15% − 1% = **14.00%** |
| **Top-Up Tax** | €1,986,500 × 14% = **€278,110** |
| Collection mechanism | **IIR to UK** |

**Ireland QDMTT Calculation**

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| GloBE Income | **€15,000,000** |
| Covered Taxes | **€1,770,000** |
| ETR | **11.80%** |
| SBIE (9% payroll + 7% assets) | €9,000,000 × 9% + €8,500,000 × 7% = **€1,405,000** |
| Excess Profit | €15,000,000 − €1,405,000 = **€13,595,000** |
| Top-Up Tax % | 15% − 11.80% = **3.20%** |
| **QDMTT payable to Ireland** | €13,595,000 × 3.20% = **€435,040** |
| IIR to UK | **€0** (QDMTT Safe Harbour) |

**JV Top-Up Tax (Stratos's Share)**

The TechStart JV is calculated separately. From Case Study 6:
- JV Total Top-Up Tax: €626,270
- Stratos ownership (55%): **€344,449**
- Collection: **IIR to UK**

## Learning Points

### Point 1: Safe Harbours Dramatically Reduce Compliance Burden

Of Stratos's 7 jurisdictions:
- **4** qualified for CbCR Safe Harbour (UK, Germany, Luxembourg, USA)
- **1** qualified for QDMTT Safe Harbour (Ireland)
- **2** required full calculation (Singapore, Cayman)

**Compliance savings:** ~70% of jurisdictions avoided full GloBE calculations.

### Point 2: FY 2025 Uses 16% Transition Rate

The Simplified ETR Test threshold for FY 2025 is **16%**, not 15%:

| Fiscal Year | Transition Rate |
|-------------|-----------------|
| FY 2024 | 15% |
| **FY 2025** | **16%** |
| FY 2026 | 17% |

USA passed at 21.11% ≥ 16%; Ireland failed at 11.88% < 16%.

### Point 3: QDMTT Safe Harbour Eliminates Residual IIR

Ireland's QDMTT Safe Harbour means:
- **QDMTT paid locally:** €435,040
- **IIR to UK:** €0

Without the Safe Harbour, Stratos might face dual calculation burden and potential residual IIR.

### Point 4: Transition Year DTA Adjustments Are Material

Germany DTA remeasurement:
- Original DTA: €3,800,000
- GloBE value: €1,900,000
- **Reduction: €1,900,000**

This adjustment reduces the DTA available for future ETR calculations.

### Point 5: Central Filing Simplifies Process

By filing through the UK as DFE:
- **One GIR** filed centrally
- Data exchanged to other jurisdictions via MCAA
- Local QDMTT filings still required separately

### Point 6: Documentation Is Critical

The audit file ensures:
- Defensible Safe Harbour claims
- Support for calculations
- Evidence of review and sign-off
- Basis for future year comparisons

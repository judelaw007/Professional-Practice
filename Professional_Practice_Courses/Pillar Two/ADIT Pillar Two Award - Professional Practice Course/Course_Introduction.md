# Course Introduction

## ADIT Pillar Two Award — Professional Practice Course

**Developed by MojiTax**

---

## What is Pillar Two?

Pillar Two represents the most significant change to international corporate taxation in a generation. Formally known as the **Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Rules**, Pillar Two establishes a global minimum effective tax rate of **15%** for multinational enterprise (MNE) groups with annual consolidated revenue of **€750 million or more**.

The rules were developed by the **OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS**, with over 145 jurisdictions committed to implementation. The framework consists of:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Income Inclusion Rule (IIR)** | Primary charging mechanism — parent jurisdiction collects Top-up Tax on low-taxed subsidiaries |
| **Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR)** | Backstop mechanism — allocates Top-up Tax to jurisdictions where IIR is not applied |
| **Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT)** | Domestic alternative — allows source jurisdictions to collect Top-up Tax before IIR/UTPR |
| **Subject to Tax Rule (STTR)** | Treaty-based rule — allows source jurisdictions to impose additional withholding on certain payments |

### Implementation Timeline

- **December 2021:** OECD releases GloBE Model Rules
- **2022-2023:** Commentary and Administrative Guidance published
- **January 2024:** First IIR rules come into effect (UK, EU, South Korea, others)
- **January 2025:** UTPR rules begin applying
- **2024-2026:** Transitional Safe Harbour period
- **Ongoing:** Jurisdictions continue implementing; OECD releases periodic guidance updates

### Why Does Pillar Two Matter?

For tax professionals, Pillar Two creates an entirely new compliance obligation:

1. **Complexity** — The GloBE Model Rules span 10 Articles with extensive Commentary and Administrative Guidance
2. **Data requirements** — GloBE calculations require 122+ data points per jurisdiction
3. **Global coordination** — MNE groups must coordinate calculations across all jurisdictions
4. **Ongoing evolution** — The OECD continues releasing Administrative Guidance, requiring constant monitoring
5. **Professional demand** — Organisations urgently need qualified professionals who can implement these rules

## The MojiTax Approach: Professional Practice

### What is a Professional Practice Course?

Unlike traditional study materials that focus on **explaining rules**, a Professional Practice Course focuses on **implementing rules**.

| Traditional Approach | Professional Practice Approach |
|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| "The ETR is calculated under Article 5.1..." | "Here is how you calculate the ETR step-by-step..." |
| Explains what the rule says | Shows how to apply the rule |
| Theory-focused | Implementation-focused |
| Prepares you to answer exam questions | Prepares you to do the work |

This course assumes you already understand (or will learn separately) the theoretical foundations of Pillar Two. Our focus is on giving you the practical skills to:

- Calculate GloBE Income for a real entity
- Determine Covered Taxes and handle complex allocations
- Compute jurisdictional ETRs and Top-up Tax
- Complete a GloBE Information Return
- Establish compliance processes and governance frameworks

### HOW, Not WHAT

Every chapter in this course starts with **HOW** — the practical steps a tax professional takes to implement Pillar Two compliance.

**Example — Traditional approach:**
> "Article 3.2.1 provides that GloBE Income is determined by adjusting Financial Accounting Net Income for certain items..."

**Example — Professional Practice approach:**
> "To calculate GloBE Income, follow these steps:
> 1. Extract Net Income from the entity's financial statements
> 2. Remove excluded dividends (ownership ≥10%, held ≥12 months)
> 3. Add back excluded equity gains/losses
> 4. Adjust for policy disallowed expenditures..."

### Inline Article Citations

While we focus on practical implementation, this is still an exam preparation course. We cite **Article references inline** where rules are applied, so you can:

- Quickly locate the relevant rule in your permitted texts
- Practice the citation style expected in exam answers
- Build familiarity with the Model Rules structure

**Citation format used:** "(Article X.X.X)" or "(Commentary, para. X)"

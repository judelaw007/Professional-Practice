### Task 5: Scope Determination Summary

---

**STRATOS GROUP PLC**
**Pillar Two Scope Determination — FY 2025**

**1. Revenue Threshold**

Stratos **meets** the €750 million revenue threshold for FY 2025.

- Years exceeding threshold: **3** of 4
- Threshold years: FY 2022, FY 2023, FY 2024

**2. Constituent Entities**

Total Constituent Entities in scope: **20**

Comprising:
- Fully consolidated subsidiaries: **18**
- PEs as separate CEs: **1** (Belgium PE)
- Entities excluded on materiality (but initially counted as CEs): **1** (SG Pension Trustees Ltd)

**3. Excluded Entities**

Total Excluded Entities: **2**

| Entity | Exclusion Category |
|--------|-------------------|
| SG Pension Trustees Ltd | Pension Fund |
| Stratos Foundation | Non-Profit Organisation |

**4. UPE and IPEs**

UPE: **Stratos Group plc** (Jurisdiction: **UK**)

IPEs identified: **6**

| IPE | Jurisdiction |
|-----|--------------|
| SG Holdings Ltd | UK |
| SG Netherlands BV | Netherlands |
| SG Singapore Pte Ltd | Singapore |
| SG US Holdings Inc | USA |
| SG Ireland Ltd | Ireland |
| TechStart Ltd | Ireland |

**5. Key Observations**

1. **Mid-year acquisition:** TechStart Ltd and its subsidiaries were acquired on 1 July 2024. GloBE calculations for these entities will cover only the post-acquisition period (1 July – 31 December 2024) for FY 2024.

2. **Belgium PE:** SG France SAS has a PE in Belgium that must be treated as a separate CE. Belgium PE income and taxes must be calculated separately from the French main entity.

3. **IIR application:** The UK has implemented a Qualified IIR. Stratos Group plc (UK UPE) will apply the IIR and bear Top-Up Tax liability for low-taxed jurisdictions.

4. **Jurisdictional spread:** The group operates in 10 jurisdictions: UK, Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Ireland, Singapore, Hong Kong, USA, Australia, Japan. Each requires separate ETR calculation.

5. **Low-tax risk jurisdictions:** Based on statutory rates, Singapore (17%), Ireland (12.5%), and Hong Kong (16.5%) may produce ETRs below 15% and require detailed analysis in Parts 3-5.

**6. Conclusion**

Stratos Group plc **is within scope** of the GloBE Rules for FY 2025.

The group has **20 Constituent Entities** across **10 jurisdictions** subject to GloBE calculations.

---

## Learning Points

1. **Revenue threshold is applied at group level** — individual entity revenues are irrelevant for scope purposes.

2. **Currency conversion matters** — a group that appears below threshold in local currency may exceed €750M after EUR conversion, or vice versa.

3. **PEs are separate CEs** — Belgium PE income must be carved out from France and calculated separately for Belgian jurisdictional ETR.

4. **Excluded entities are still identified through the CE process** — SG Pension Trustees was initially a CE (excluded from consolidation on materiality, not on substance), then separately assessed for Excluded Entity status.

5. **Not all equity method investments need Excluded Entity analysis** — Asian Technology JV Ltd and Singapore Gov JV Pte Ltd are not CEs (under 50% ownership), so they are outside GloBE scope without needing exclusion analysis.

6. **IPE identification is critical for IIR application** — if the UK did not have a Qualified IIR, the IPE chain would determine which jurisdiction's IIR applies.

7. **Document everything** — the scope determination memo creates an audit trail for regulators and advisors.

## Next Step

You have completed Part 1: Scope Determination. Proceed to **Part 2: The Charging Mechanism—IIR and UTPR** to learn how Top-Up Tax is allocated through the ownership chain you have just mapped.

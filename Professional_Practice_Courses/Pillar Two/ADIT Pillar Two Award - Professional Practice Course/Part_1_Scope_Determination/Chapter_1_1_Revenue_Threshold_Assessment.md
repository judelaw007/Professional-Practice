# Chapter 1.1: Revenue Threshold Assessment

## Learning Objective

After completing this chapter, you will be able to determine whether an MNE group meets the €750 million consolidated revenue threshold and document this assessment for compliance purposes.

## 1. The Threshold Test

An MNE group falls within scope of the GloBE Rules if consolidated group revenue equals or exceeds **€750 million** in at least **two of the four fiscal years** immediately preceding the tested fiscal year *(Article 1.1.1)*.

This is a binary test applied at the group level—individual entity revenues are irrelevant for this purpose.

## 2. Identifying the Revenue Figure

### 2.1 Which Line Item?

Use **total revenue** from the consolidated financial statements of the Ultimate Parent Entity. This is typically labelled as:
- "Revenue" (IFRS 15)
- "Net sales" or "Total revenues" (US GAAP)
- Equivalent line under authorised local GAAP

**Include:**
- Sales of goods and services
- Royalty income
- Interest and dividend income (if presented as revenue)
- Other operating income included in the revenue line

**Do not include:**
- Items presented below the revenue line (e.g., other comprehensive income)
- Consolidation eliminations already reflected in the consolidated figure

### 2.2 Which Financial Statements?

Use the **audited consolidated financial statements** filed with regulators or prepared under statutory requirements *(Article 1.1.1; Commentary, para. 6)*. If audited statements are unavailable for a historic year, use the best available figures and document the source.

For groups reporting under multiple accounting standards (e.g., IFRS for group reporting, local GAAP for statutory accounts), use the figures from the **primary consolidated financial statements** used for external reporting.

## 3. Currency Conversion

If the consolidated financial statements are prepared in a currency other than EUR, convert the revenue figure.

### 3.1 Conversion Methodology

Use the **average exchange rate for the fiscal year** being tested *(Commentary, para. 8)*.

**Acceptable sources for exchange rates:**
- European Central Bank (ECB) annual average rates
- Central bank of the reporting jurisdiction
- Rate published in the group's audited financial statements

**Formula:**
```
Revenue (EUR) = Revenue (local currency) × Average EUR/local currency rate for the fiscal year
```

### 3.2 Practical Approach

Many groups already disclose EUR-equivalent figures in their annual reports for investor communication. Where available and sourced from the audited financials, these can be used directly.

**Documentation requirement:** Record the exchange rate used and its source for each converted year.

## 4. The Four-Year Look-Back

### 4.1 Determining the Relevant Years

For any fiscal year being tested, examine the **four fiscal years immediately preceding** it.

| Tested Fiscal Year | Look-Back Period |
|-------------------|------------------|
| FY ending 31 Dec 2025 | FY 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 |
| FY ending 30 Jun 2026 | FY ending Jun 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 |
| FY ending 31 Mar 2026 | FY ending Mar 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 |

### 4.2 Groups With Fewer Than Four Years of History

If the group has existed for fewer than four fiscal years, the test applies to the years that exist:
- **Three years of history:** Must meet threshold in at least two of three years
- **Two years of history:** Must meet threshold in at least two of two years (i.e., both years)
- **One year of history:** Must meet threshold in that year

Newly formed groups from mergers are assessed based on the combined historical revenues of the predecessor groups as if they had been consolidated throughout the look-back period *(Article 6.1.1)*.

## 5. Worked Example: Stratos Group

### 5.1 Background

Stratos Group plc is a UK-headquartered technology company with a 31 December year-end. The group CFO needs to determine whether Stratos is in scope for Pillar Two for FY 2025.

### 5.2 Data Gathering

The finance team extracts revenue figures from the past four years of audited consolidated financial statements:

| Fiscal Year | Revenue per Audited Accounts | Currency |
|-------------|------------------------------|----------|
| FY 2021 | £625,400,000 | GBP |
| FY 2022 | £679,800,000 | GBP |
| FY 2023 | £744,600,000 | GBP |
| FY 2024 | £819,500,000 | GBP |

### 5.3 Currency Conversion

Stratos reports in GBP. The team obtains ECB annual average EUR/GBP rates:

| Fiscal Year | ECB Average Rate (EUR/GBP) |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| FY 2021 | 1.1630 |
| FY 2022 | 1.1729 |
| FY 2023 | 1.1499 |
| FY 2024 | 1.1453 |

### 5.4 Threshold Assessment

| Fiscal Year | Revenue (GBP) | EUR/GBP Rate | Revenue (EUR) | ≥ €750M? |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| FY 2021 | £625.4M | 1.1630 | €727.3M | No |
| FY 2022 | £679.8M | 1.1729 | €797.3M | **Yes** |
| FY 2023 | £744.6M | 1.1499 | €856.2M | **Yes** |
| FY 2024 | £819.5M | 1.1453 | €938.6M | **Yes** |

### 5.5 Conclusion

Three of four years exceed the €750 million threshold. Stratos is **in scope for Pillar Two for FY 2025**.

### 5.6 Documentation

The tax team prepares a file note recording:
- Source documents (audited financial statements for each year)
- Exchange rates used and their source (ECB)
- Calculation workings
- Conclusion and date of assessment

## 6. Near-Threshold Situations

Groups with revenues close to €750 million require careful monitoring.

### 6.1 Revenue Between €700M and €800M

If consolidated revenue fluctuates around the threshold:

1. **Perform the assessment annually** — scope status can change year to year
2. **Monitor quarterly revenue trends** — early warning of potential scope entry
3. **Consider currency volatility** — a group below threshold in local currency may exceed it after EUR conversion in a weak currency year

### 6.2 Falling Out of Scope

A group can exit scope if revenue falls below €750 million in three of the four look-back years. However, this requires:
- Genuine reduction in business activity, OR
- Significant disposal of group entities

Reorganisations designed primarily to avoid the threshold may be challenged under anti-avoidance provisions.

## 7. Impact of Corporate Events

### 7.1 Acquisitions During Look-Back Period

When an entity is acquired mid-year:
- Include its revenue **from the acquisition date only**
- Do not annualise or gross up partial-year revenue
- The acquiring group's look-back includes the target's post-acquisition revenue

**Example:** Stratos acquires TechStart on 1 July 2024. For the FY 2024 threshold assessment, include TechStart's revenue from 1 July to 31 December 2024 only (six months).

### 7.2 Disposals During Look-Back Period

When entities are disposed of:
- Include their revenue up to the disposal date
- The look-back reflects the group composition at each point in time

### 7.3 Mergers

When two groups merge:
- Assess combined revenues as if the merged group had existed throughout the look-back period
- Both predecessor groups' revenues are aggregated for each year

### 7.4 Demergers

When a group splits:
- Each resulting group is assessed based on its own post-demerger revenue
- The look-back for the first post-demerger year requires allocation of pre-demerger revenue to each resulting group on a reasonable basis

## 8. Documentation Requirements

Maintain a threshold assessment file containing:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Audited consolidated financial statements (4 years) | Source of revenue figures |
| Revenue extraction workings | Shows which line item was used |
| Exchange rate source documentation | ECB printout or equivalent |
| Conversion calculations | Audit trail for EUR figures |
| Assessment conclusion memo | Formal record of scope determination |
| Annual review record | Evidence of ongoing monitoring |

**Retention period:** Retain documentation for at least 7 years from the end of the relevant fiscal year, or longer if required by local tax authority record-keeping rules.

# Chapter 1.1: Revenue Threshold Assessment

## Learning Objective

After completing this chapter, you will be able to determine whether an MNE group meets the €750 million consolidated revenue threshold for Pillar Two.

---

## The Test

An MNE group is in scope if consolidated group revenue equals or exceeds **€750 million** in at least **two of the four fiscal years** immediately preceding the tested fiscal year.

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Identify the Relevant Fiscal Years

For fiscal year 2025 assessment, examine:
- FY 2021, FY 2022, FY 2023, FY 2024

### Step 2: Obtain Consolidated Revenue Figures

Source: **Consolidated financial statements** of the Ultimate Parent Entity

Use revenue as reported under the applicable accounting standard (IFRS, US GAAP, or authorised local GAAP).

### Step 3: Apply Currency Conversion (if needed)

If financial statements are not in EUR:
- Use the **average exchange rate** for each fiscal year
- Source: European Central Bank or equivalent central bank

### Step 4: Count Qualifying Years

| Fiscal Year | Consolidated Revenue | ≥ €750M? |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|
| FY 2021 | [Amount] | Yes / No |
| FY 2022 | [Amount] | Yes / No |
| FY 2023 | [Amount] | Yes / No |
| FY 2024 | [Amount] | Yes / No |

**Result:** If 2 or more years = "Yes" → Group is **in scope**

## Worked Example: GlobalTech Industries

**Scenario:** GlobalTech has a 31 December year-end. Determine if the group is in scope for FY 2025.

| Fiscal Year | Revenue (GBP) | EUR/GBP Rate | Revenue (EUR) | ≥ €750M? |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| FY 2021 | £625M | 1.163 | €727M | No |
| FY 2022 | £680M | 1.173 | €798M | **Yes** |
| FY 2023 | £745M | 1.150 | €857M | **Yes** |
| FY 2024 | £820M | 1.145 | €939M | **Yes** |

**Conclusion:** 3 of 4 years exceed €750M → GlobalTech is **in scope for FY 2025**

## Common Issues

### Mid-Year Acquisitions

If an entity is acquired mid-year, its revenue is included from the acquisition date only. Do **not** annualise for threshold purposes.

### Demergers

If the group demerged during the look-back period, assess based on the revenue of the resulting group as if it had existed throughout.

### Different Accounting Standards

If subsidiaries use different local GAAP, use the consolidated figures from the UPE's financial statements—these will already reflect consolidation adjustments.

## Key Reference

**OECD GloBE Model Rules, Article 1.1.1**

> "The GloBE Rules apply to Constituent Entities that are members of an MNE Group that has annual revenue of EUR 750 million or more in the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Ultimate Parent Entity in at least two of the four Fiscal Years immediately preceding the tested Fiscal Year."

---

## Next Steps

Once you confirm the group meets the revenue threshold, proceed to **Chapter 1.2: Identifying Constituent Entities** to map which entities fall within the GloBE scope.

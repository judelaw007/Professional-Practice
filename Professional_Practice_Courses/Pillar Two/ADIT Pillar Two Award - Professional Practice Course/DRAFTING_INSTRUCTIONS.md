# Drafting Instructions for ADIT Pillar Two Professional Practice Course

## Before Drafting Each Note

1. **Review the Professional Practice Course standard** in `What_is_a_Professional_Practice_Course.md` — focus on implementation, not theory

2. **Check the Development Plan** in this folder for the specific Part's:
   - Chapter structure
   - Learning objectives
   - Case study requirements
   - Tool integration points

3. **Review the GloBE Information Return course** in `../GloBE Information Return: Complete Filing Implementation/` for potential alignment — reuse content where it fits naturally, but do not force alignment if it disrupts flow

## When Drafting

- **Start with HOW**, not WHAT — assume reader knows Pillar Two basics
- **Show, don't describe** — include worked examples, flowcharts, checklists inline
- **One note at a time** — complete and review before moving to next
- **GlobalTech storyline** — use consistent scenario data across Parts
- **Tools reference** — mention GIR-001 to GIR-006 where practice adds value
- **Case study at end** — only if Part benefits from hands-on practice

## Citing Authorities (ADIT Exam Requirement)

This is a professional exam course — cite authorities strategically:

- **Place citations where the rule is stated**, not just at the bottom
- **Format:** "(Article X.X)" or "(Commentary, para. X)" inline with the text
- **Do not flood** the chapter with citations — one per key rule is sufficient
- **Do not discuss** the authority itself — just cite and move on
- **Key references section** at the end can summarise, but main citations should appear in context

## Quality Check

Does this note enable a practitioner to DO something tomorrow? If not, revise.

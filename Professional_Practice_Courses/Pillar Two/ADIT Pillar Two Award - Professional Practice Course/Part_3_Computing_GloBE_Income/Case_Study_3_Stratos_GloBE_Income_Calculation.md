### Task 2: Adjustment Analysis

| # | Item | Required? | Article | Direction | Amount (€) |
|---|------|-----------|---------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | Tax expense | **Yes** | 3.2.1(a) | **Add** | 12,100,000 |
| 2 | Intra-group dividend | **Yes** | 3.2.1(b) | **Deduct** | (3,100,000) |
| 3 | Stock-based compensation | **Optional** | 3.2.2 | See Task 3 | — |
| 4 | Foreign currency gain | **No** | 3.2.1(f) | — | — |
| 5 | Fines and penalties | **Yes** | 3.2.1(g) | **Add** | 300,000 |
| 6 | Prior year adjustment | **Yes** | 3.2.1(h) | **Deduct** | (500,000) |
| 7 | Pension expense | **Yes** | 3.2.1(i) | **Deduct** | (300,000) |

**Detailed Analysis:**

**1. Tax Expense (€12,100,000) — ADD**
- Article 3.2.1(a) requires adding back net taxes expense
- Include both current tax (€11.2M) and deferred tax (€0.9M)
- **Add €12,100,000**

**2. Intra-Group Dividend (€3,100,000) — DEDUCT**
- From 100% subsidiary, held >12 months
- Meets Excluded Dividend criteria under Article 3.2.1(b)
- Ownership ≥10% = Excluded
- **Deduct €3,100,000**

**3. Stock-Based Compensation — OPTIONAL**
- See Task 3 analysis
- If elected: Substitute €1,800,000 tax deduction for €2,400,000 accounting expense
- Effect: Increase GloBE Income by €600,000

**4. Foreign Currency Gain (€900,000) — NO ADJUSTMENT**
- Article 3.2.1(f) only applies to **asymmetric** FX gains/losses
- SG Germany's accounting and tax functional currencies are both EUR
- No asymmetry exists
- The FX gain on the USD loan is properly included in GloBE Income
- **No adjustment required**

**5. Fines and Penalties (€300,000) — ADD**
- Environmental regulatory fine = €300,000
- Threshold for policy disallowed: ≥€50,000
- €300,000 > €50,000, so adjustment required
- **Add €300,000**

**6. Prior Year Adjustment (€500,000) — DEDUCT**
- Correction of FY 2024 revenue overstatement
- Opens FY 2025 with lower retained earnings
- Article 3.2.1(h) requires adjustment
- The overstatement was in FY 2024 GloBE Income; now correcting
- Effect on FY 2025: **Deduct €500,000**

**7. Pension Expense — DEDUCT**
- IAS 19 expense: €1,800,000
- Contributions paid: €1,500,000
- Accrued Pension Expense = €1,800,000 − €1,500,000 = €300,000
- Article 3.2.1(i): Deduct accrued amount exceeding contributions
- **Deduct €300,000**

### Task 3: Stock-Based Compensation Election Analysis

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Is Germany a low-tax jurisdiction (ETR < 15%)? | **No** — Expected ETR ~28-30% |
| Is tax deduction > or < accounting expense? | **Less** — €1.8M < €2.4M |
| What is the impact of the election on GloBE Income? | **Increases** GloBE Income by €600,000 |
| Is share price expected to continue rising? | **Yes** — Up 58% since grant |
| Is there significant forfeiture/expiry risk? | **Low** — Year 3 of 4-year vest |

**Recommendation:** **Do NOT Elect**

**Rationale:**

1. **Germany is high-tax:** With expected ETR of ~28-30%, Germany is well above the 15% minimum. Top-Up Tax will not arise regardless of the election.

2. **Tax deduction < Accounting expense:** The election would substitute €1.8M (tax) for €2.4M (accounting), increasing GloBE Income by €600,000. This has no benefit since Germany is already high-tax.

3. **No ETR improvement needed:** The election's purpose is to align GloBE Income with tax treatment to prevent artificial ETR reduction. Since Germany's ETR is already high, this alignment provides no benefit.

4. **Future consideration:** If share price continues rising, the tax deduction at exercise could exceed the accounting expense. However, this would only matter if Germany's ETR approached 15%, which is unlikely given the 30% statutory rate.

5. **Administrative simplicity:** Not electing avoids the need to track tax deductions separately and manage potential recapture if options expire.

### Task 5: Adjustment Summary Memo

---

**STRATOS GROUP PLC**
**GloBE Income Calculation — SG Germany GmbH**
**Fiscal Year 2025**

**1. Starting Point**

| Item | Amount (€) |
|------|------------|
| Financial Accounting Net Income | **45,200,000** |
| Source | IFRS financial statements per UPE consolidation |
| Accounting standard | IFRS (no Article 3.1.3 exception required) |

**2. Adjustment Summary**

| Adjustment | Article | Amount (€) | Notes |
|------------|---------|------------|-------|
| Net taxes expense | 3.2.1(a) | +12,100,000 | Current €11.2M + Deferred €0.9M |
| Excluded dividends | 3.2.1(b) | (3,100,000) | From 100% subsidiary; held >12 months |
| Foreign currency | 3.2.1(f) | — | No asymmetry (EUR/EUR) |
| Fines and penalties | 3.2.1(g) | +300,000 | Environmental fine; exceeds €50K threshold |
| Prior year adjustment | 3.2.1(h) | (500,000) | FY 2024 revenue overstatement correction |
| Pension adjustment | 3.2.1(i) | (300,000) | Accrual €1.8M less contributions €1.5M |
| Stock-based compensation | 3.2.2 | — | Election not made (see below) |
| **Total Adjustments** | | **+8,500,000** | |

**3. GloBE Income**

| Item | Amount (€) |
|------|------------|
| Financial Accounting Net Income | 45,200,000 |
| Total Adjustments | +8,500,000 |
| **GloBE Income** | **53,700,000** |

**4. Elections Applied**

| Election | Applied? | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Stock-based compensation (Art. 3.2.2) | **No** | Germany is high-tax (~28-30% ETR); election would increase GloBE Income without ETR benefit; tax deduction (€1.8M) < accounting expense (€2.4M) |
| Realization method (Art. 3.2.5) | **No** | No fair value assets requiring consideration |

**5. Key Observations**

1. **High-tax jurisdiction:** Germany's expected ETR of ~28-30% is well above the 15% minimum. No Top-Up Tax is expected for this jurisdiction.

2. **Excluded dividend:** The €3.1M dividend from SG Germany Sales GmbH qualifies for exclusion due to 100% ownership and >12 month holding period. This reduces GloBE Income but has no impact on Top-Up Tax given Germany's high ETR.

3. **Prior year adjustment:** The €500,000 reduction relates to a FY 2024 revenue overstatement. FY 2024 GloBE calculations should be reviewed for potential Additional Current Top-Up Tax under Article 5.4.1, though given Germany's high ETR, no Top-Up Tax impact is expected.

4. **Pension timing difference:** The €300,000 adjustment aligns GloBE Income with contributions paid (€1.5M) rather than IAS 19 expense (€1.8M). This is a timing difference that will reverse over the life of the pension scheme.

5. **Foreign currency:** The €900,000 FX gain on the USD intercompany loan is correctly included in GloBE Income. No asymmetric adjustment is required because both accounting and tax use EUR as functional currency.

## Learning Points

1. **Start with the right accounts:** Financial Accounting Net Income per IFRS consolidated accounts is the correct starting point. No Article 3.1.3 exception was needed because Germany uses the same standard as the UPE.

2. **Tax expense is always added back:** This converts the "after-tax" accounting figure to a "pre-tax" GloBE Income figure. Include both current and deferred tax.

3. **Dividend exclusion requires analysis:** Not all dividends are excluded. Check ownership (≥10%) OR holding period (≥12 months). The 100% subsidiary dividend clearly qualifies.

4. **Asymmetric FX only applies to currency mismatches:** If accounting and tax functional currencies are aligned, there is no asymmetric adjustment—even if the transaction is in a third currency.

5. **€50,000 threshold for fines:** The environmental fine (€300,000) exceeds the threshold, so it is added back. A smaller fine would not require adjustment.

6. **Pension adjustment can go either direction:** When contributions exceed accrual, add to GloBE Income. When accrual exceeds contributions (as here), deduct from GloBE Income.

7. **SBC election requires strategic analysis:** Don't automatically elect. In high-tax jurisdictions like Germany, the election provides no benefit and may increase GloBE Income unnecessarily.

8. **Document everything:** The adjustment memo creates an audit trail for regulators, advisors, and future years' calculations.

## Reconciliation to ETR

For context, here is how the GloBE Income feeds into the ETR calculation:

| Item | Amount (€) |
|------|------------|
| **GloBE Income** | **53,700,000** |
| Adjusted Covered Taxes (assumed) | 15,100,000* |
| **ETR** | **28.1%** |

*Assumes Covered Taxes of approximately €15.1M after Covered Tax adjustments.

**Result:** Germany ETR of 28.1% is well above 15%. No Top-Up Tax arises.

---

## Alternative Scenario: What If Germany Were Low-Tax?

For additional practice, consider this alternative scenario:

**Assume:** SG Germany GmbH benefits from a special R&D tax incentive that reduces its effective tax rate to 12%.

**Questions:**
1. Would the stock-based compensation election be beneficial?
2. What would be the Top-Up Tax calculation?

**Analysis:**

With 12% ETR:
- Top-Up Tax Percentage = 15% − 12% = 3%
- SBC election would **increase** GloBE Income by €600,000
- **Increased** GloBE Income = Higher Excess Profit = Higher Top-Up Tax

**Recommendation in low-tax scenario:** Still **do not elect** for Germany, because:
- Tax deduction (€1.8M) < Accounting expense (€2.4M)
- Keeping the higher accounting expense (€2.4M) means **lower** GloBE Income
- Lower GloBE Income = Lower Top-Up Tax

**Key insight:** The election is only beneficial when tax deduction > accounting expense AND the jurisdiction is near the 15% threshold.

---

## Integration with GIR Filing

The GloBE Income calculated in this case study feeds directly into the GIR:

| GIR Section | Data From This Case Study |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Section 2.1: Financial Accounting Net Income | €45,200,000 |
| Section 2.2: Adjustments | +€8,500,000 total |
| Section 2.3: GloBE Income | €53,700,000 |
| Section 2.4: Elections | SBC election: Not applied |

Use **GIR-001 GloBE Calculator** to input the final GloBE Income figure and proceed with ETR → SBIE → Top-Up Tax calculations.

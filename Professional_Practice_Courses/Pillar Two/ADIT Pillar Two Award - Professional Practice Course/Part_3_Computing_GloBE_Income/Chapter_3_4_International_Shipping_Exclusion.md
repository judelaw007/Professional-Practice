# Chapter 3.4: International Shipping Exclusion

## Learning Objective

After completing this chapter, you will be able to identify qualifying international shipping income, apply the ancillary income cap, and exclude eligible shipping income from GloBE calculations while meeting substance requirements.

## Introduction

The international shipping exclusion represents one of the most significant carve-outs from the global minimum tax framework. Its inclusion in Article 3.3 reflects decades of international consensus that shipping—an inherently mobile, capital-intensive industry essential to global trade—requires special tax treatment to remain commercially viable. Nearly every major maritime nation operates some form of tonnage tax or preferential shipping regime, and subjecting these regimes to the 15% minimum would have effectively dismantled them overnight. The exclusion preserves this status quo while carefully defining boundaries to prevent abuse and ensure the benefit flows only to genuine shipping operations.

## Why Shipping Gets Special Treatment

The international shipping industry has unique characteristics that have led many jurisdictions to adopt special tax regimes:

| Characteristic | Impact |
|----------------|--------|
| **Capital intensive** | Large upfront investment in vessels |
| **Long economic cycles** | Ships operate for 20-30 years |
| **Volatile earnings** | Charter rates fluctuate significantly |
| **Global mobility** | Ships can easily change flag states |

Many countries operate **tonnage tax** regimes that tax shipping based on vessel tonnage rather than actual profits. These regimes typically result in effective tax rates of **1-2%**, well below the 15% GloBE minimum.

**Without an exclusion:** Shipping companies would face Top-Up Tax on virtually all profits, undermining the policy rationale behind tonnage tax regimes.

**Article 3.3 solution:** Exclude qualifying international shipping income from GloBE calculations entirely.

The shipping industry's political weight in maritime nations—combined with the genuine economic case for stable, predictable taxation of long-lived mobile assets—made this exclusion one of the less contested elements of the Pillar Two negotiations. Countries like Greece, Denmark, Norway, and Singapore have built substantial maritime clusters around their favourable shipping regimes; dismantling these through Pillar Two would have redistributed not just tax revenue but economic activity. The compromise reached—preserving existing benefits for genuine shipping while requiring substance and limiting ancillary activities—reflects a pragmatic accommodation of maritime interests within the broader minimum tax framework.

## The Basic Exclusion Rule *(Article 3.3.1)*

### What Gets Excluded

For MNE Groups with International Shipping Income:

| Item | Treatment |
|------|-----------|
| International Shipping Income | **Excluded** from GloBE Income |
| Qualified Ancillary International Shipping Income | **Excluded** from GloBE Income (up to 50% cap) |
| International Shipping Losses | **Excluded** from GloBE Loss |

**Key point:** Both income AND losses from qualifying shipping activities are excluded. The exclusion is symmetrical.

## Definition: International Shipping Income *(Article 3.3.2)*

### Qualifying Activities

International Shipping Income means net income from:

| Activity | Description | Reference |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **(a) Direct transport** | Transportation of passengers or cargo by ships in international traffic (owned, leased, or otherwise at disposal) | Art. 3.3.2(a) |
| **(b) Slot chartering** | Transportation under slot-chartering arrangements | Art. 3.3.2(b) |
| **(c) Time charter out** | Leasing a ship on charter fully equipped, crewed, and supplied | Art. 3.3.2(c) |
| **(d) Bareboat to CE** | Leasing a ship on bareboat charter to another Constituent Entity | Art. 3.3.2(d) |
| **(e) Pools/joint ventures** | Participation in pools, joint businesses, or international operating agencies | Art. 3.3.2(e) |

### What Does NOT Qualify

| Excluded Activity | Reason |
|-------------------|--------|
| **Inland waterways** | Transport via rivers, canals, lakes within same jurisdiction |
| **Domestic coastal shipping** | Ships operating solely between places in one jurisdiction |
| **Aircraft operations** | Article 3.3 covers ships only; aircraft covered by separate treaty provisions |

### Definition: International Traffic

**International traffic** = Transport by a ship, except when operated **solely** between places within a single jurisdiction.

| Route | International Traffic? |
|-------|----------------------|
| Rotterdam → Singapore | **Yes** |
| Southampton → New York | **Yes** |
| Hamburg → Rotterdam | **Yes** (crosses borders) |
| Liverpool → Southampton | **No** (within UK only) |
| Up the Thames (London) | **No** (inland, same jurisdiction) |

## Qualified Ancillary International Shipping Income *(Article 3.3.3)*

### What Qualifies

Ancillary activities that are performed **primarily in connection with** international shipping:

| Ancillary Activity | Conditions |
|-------------------|------------|
| **(a) Bareboat charter to non-CEs** | Charter period ≤ 3 years |
| **(b) Ticket sales** | Selling tickets issued by other shipping enterprises for domestic leg of international voyage |
| **(c) Container services** | Leasing, short-term storage, detention charges for late return |
| **(d) Personnel services** | Engineers, maintenance, cargo handlers, catering, customer services to other shipping enterprises |
| **(e) Investment income** | From investments made as integral part of shipping business |

### What Does NOT Qualify as Ancillary

| Activity | Why Not Ancillary |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Inland transportation** | Explicitly excluded to prevent competitive distortion with land logistics providers |
| **Port operations** | Separate business from shipping |
| **Shipyard/repair services** | Manufacturing/service business |
| **Freight forwarding (land-based)** | Not primarily connected to ship operations |

## The 50% Ancillary Income Cap *(Article 3.3.5)*

### The Rule

**Qualified Ancillary International Shipping Income cannot exceed 50% of International Shipping Income** for all Constituent Entities in a jurisdiction.

### Formula

```
Maximum Ancillary Exclusion = International Shipping Income × 50%

If Actual Ancillary Income > Maximum:
    Excluded Amount = Maximum (50% of ISI)
    Excess = Included in GloBE Income
```

### Worked Example: Ancillary Cap Calculation

**Facts:** Maritime CE in Singapore

| Income Type | Amount (€) |
|-------------|------------|
| International Shipping Income | 70,000,000 |
| Qualified Ancillary Income (actual) | 40,000,000 |
| Non-shipping income | 15,000,000 |

**Step 1: Calculate 50% cap**

```
Maximum Ancillary = €70,000,000 × 50% = €35,000,000
```

**Step 2: Compare to actual**

```
Actual Ancillary:  €40,000,000
Maximum Allowed:   €35,000,000
Excess:            €5,000,000
```

**Step 3: Determine exclusions**

| Item | Excluded | In GloBE Income |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| International Shipping Income | €70,000,000 | — |
| Ancillary Income (up to cap) | €35,000,000 | — |
| Ancillary Income (excess) | — | €5,000,000 |
| Non-shipping income | — | €15,000,000 |
| **Total GloBE Income** | | **€20,000,000** |

The 50% ancillary cap serves as an anti-avoidance mechanism, preventing shipping groups from sheltering unlimited amounts of non-core income under the shipping exclusion umbrella. Without this limit, a company could structure extensive container logistics, port services, or investment activities through its shipping entity and claim full exclusion. The 50% threshold acknowledges that genuine shipping operations do generate ancillary income—container handling, crew services, short-term investments of working capital—but ensures the tail cannot wag the dog. Where ancillary income exceeds core shipping income, the excess clearly represents a separate business line that should face the same minimum tax rules as any other enterprise.

## Treatment of Losses *(Article 3.3.1)*

### The Symmetry Rule

If International Shipping Income or Qualified Ancillary Income results in a **loss**, that loss is also **excluded** from GloBE calculations.

### Why This Matters

Without loss exclusion:
- Profitable years: Shipping income excluded (no GloBE benefit)
- Loss years: Shipping losses reduce other GloBE Income (benefit retained)

**Result:** Asymmetric treatment would give shipping companies a permanent advantage.

**With loss exclusion:** Losses are ring-fenced with shipping income—neither profits nor losses affect the GloBE calculation.

### Worked Example: Shipping Losses

**Facts:** Maritime CE with mixed activities

| Item | Amount (€) |
|------|------------|
| Non-shipping income | 360,000 |
| International Shipping Loss | (100,000) |
| Ancillary Shipping Loss | (60,000) |

**GloBE Income calculation:**

| Item | Adjustment |
|------|------------|
| Financial Accounting Net Income | 200,000 |
| Add back: Excluded Shipping Loss | +100,000 |
| Add back: Excluded Ancillary Loss | +60,000 |
| **GloBE Income** | **360,000** |

**Result:** The €160,000 shipping losses do not reduce the CE's GloBE Income of €360,000.

## Strategic Management Requirement *(Article 3.3.6)*

### The Substance Test

To qualify for the shipping exclusion, a Constituent Entity must demonstrate that:

> *"The strategic or commercial management of all ships concerned is effectively carried on from within the jurisdiction where the Constituent Entity is located."*

### What Constitutes Strategic Management

| Activity | Indicative of Strategic Management |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| Major capital expenditure decisions | Approving vessel purchases/sales |
| Asset disposal decisions | Determining when to scrap or sell ships |
| Awarding major contracts | Chartering agreements, major supplier contracts |
| Strategic alliances | Pool arrangements, joint ventures |
| Flag state responsibilities | Maritime safety, environmental compliance |
| Commercial voyage planning | Route decisions, cargo booking strategy |

### What Is NOT Sufficient

| Activity | Why Insufficient |
|----------|-----------------|
| Brass plate company | No real management presence |
| Administrative functions only | Invoicing, accounting without decision-making |
| Vessel registration alone | Flag state without management |
| Shareholder/board meetings only | Infrequent oversight insufficient |

### Documentation Evidence

| Document Type | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| Board meeting minutes | Evidence of strategic decisions in jurisdiction |
| Employment records | Key management personnel located in jurisdiction |
| Contracts signed | Major agreements executed locally |
| Operational reports | Management reports prepared/reviewed locally |
| Correspondence | Day-to-day management communications |

The strategic management requirement ensures that the shipping exclusion benefits jurisdictions where genuine maritime management occurs, not those that merely offer convenient registration. This prevents the proliferation of "brass plate" shipping entities that register vessels and claim exclusion while all real decisions are made elsewhere. The test looks to where capital expenditure is approved, where major contracts are negotiated and signed, where commercial strategy is developed—in essence, where the mind and management of the shipping enterprise resides. For groups with complex operations spanning multiple jurisdictions, this may require careful consideration of where decision-making authority genuinely sits, and potentially restructuring to ensure substance matches claimed exclusions.

## Interaction with Tonnage Tax Regimes

### The Potential Gap

Many tonnage tax regimes have **broader** definitions of qualifying activities than Article 3.3:

| Tonnage Tax (Example: UK) | GloBE Article 3.3 |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| International shipping | ✓ Covered |
| Domestic coastal shipping | ✗ Not covered |
| Towage and dredging | ✗ Not covered |
| Offshore support vessels | May not be covered |
| Cable laying vessels | May not be covered |

### Risk: Top-Up Tax on Non-Qualifying Activities

Activities that qualify for tonnage tax but **not** for Article 3.3 exclusion:
- Remain in GloBE Income
- Subject to 15% minimum rate
- May trigger Top-Up Tax if tonnage tax ETR < 15%

### Practical Implication

MNE Groups with shipping operations should:

1. **Map** all activities against Article 3.3 definitions
2. **Identify** activities in tonnage tax that don't qualify for GloBE exclusion
3. **Calculate** potential Top-Up Tax exposure on non-qualifying activities
4. **Consider** restructuring if exposure is material

The gap between domestic tonnage tax scope and Article 3.3 scope creates a compliance trap for unwary shipping groups. An operator that has structured its affairs to maximise tonnage tax benefits domestically may find that a significant portion of its activities—offshore support, towage, cable-laying, domestic coastal routes—falls outside the GloBE exclusion. These activities remain subject to the full Pillar Two calculation, and if the tonnage tax regime produces an ETR below 15% on this income, Top-Up Tax will arise. Groups should not assume that domestic tonnage tax qualification automatically confers GloBE exclusion; a line-by-line analysis against Article 3.3's more restrictive definitions is essential.

## Stratos Worked Example

### Background

Stratos Group plc acquired a maritime logistics subsidiary, **SG Maritime Holdings BV** (Netherlands), which operates:

- Container vessels in international traffic
- Feeder vessels for domestic Dutch coastal routes
- Container storage and handling facilities
- A vessel management company

### Entity Structure

```
SG Maritime Holdings BV (Netherlands)
    │
    ├── SG Shipping International BV (Netherlands)
    │   └── Operates 12 container vessels in international traffic
    │
    ├── SG Coastal Services BV (Netherlands)
    │   └── Operates 3 feeder vessels (Rotterdam-Amsterdam route)
    │
    └── SG Container Services BV (Netherlands)
        └── Container storage, handling, and management
```

### Step 1: Classify Income

**SG Shipping International BV**

| Income | Amount (€M) | Classification |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Charter income (international routes) | 45.0 | International Shipping Income |
| Slot charter revenue | 8.0 | International Shipping Income |
| Container detention charges | 3.5 | Qualified Ancillary |
| Investment income (working capital) | 1.2 | Qualified Ancillary |
| **Total** | **57.7** | |

**SG Coastal Services BV**

| Income | Amount (€M) | Classification |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Feeder service revenue (domestic) | 12.0 | **NOT** International Shipping |

**SG Container Services BV**

| Income | Amount (€M) | Classification |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Container storage (port facilities) | 6.0 | **NOT** Shipping (port operations) |
| Management services to group | 2.5 | Qualified Ancillary* |

*If provided to shipping CEs and primarily connected to international shipping.

### Step 2: Apply 50% Ancillary Cap

**Netherlands Jurisdiction (combined)**

| Item | Amount (€M) |
|------|-------------|
| International Shipping Income | 53.0 |
| Qualified Ancillary Income (actual) | 7.2 |
| 50% Cap | 53.0 × 50% = 26.5 |

**Result:** Ancillary income (€7.2M) is below the cap (€26.5M). Full exclusion applies.

### Step 3: Calculate GloBE Income

| Entity | Total Income | Excluded | GloBE Income |
|--------|--------------|----------|--------------|
| SG Shipping International | €57.7M | €57.7M | €0 |
| SG Coastal Services | €12.0M | €0 | €12.0M |
| SG Container Services | €8.5M | €2.5M* | €6.0M |
| **Netherlands Total** | **€78.2M** | **€60.2M** | **€18.0M** |

*Management services to group shipping CEs qualify as ancillary.

### Step 4: Check Strategic Management

**SG Shipping International BV — Assessment**

| Factor | Evidence | Satisfied? |
|--------|----------|------------|
| Capital expenditure decisions | Board approves vessel acquisitions in Amsterdam | ✓ |
| Major contracts | Charter parties signed by Dutch management | ✓ |
| Key personnel | Fleet manager, commercial director in Netherlands | ✓ |
| Operational oversight | Daily operations managed from Rotterdam | ✓ |

**Conclusion:** Strategic management requirement **satisfied** for SG Shipping International.

### Step 5: ETR Calculation (Non-Excluded Income)

| Item | Amount (€M) |
|------|-------------|
| GloBE Income (non-shipping) | 18.0 |
| Adjusted Covered Taxes | 2.7 |
| ETR | 15.0% |

**Result:** Netherlands ETR exactly at minimum. No Top-Up Tax for non-shipping activities.

## 7. Documentation Requirements

### For Article 3.3 Exclusion

Maintain documentation to support:

| Requirement | Documentation |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Qualifying income classification** | Revenue breakdown by activity type |
| **International traffic** | Voyage records showing cross-border routes |
| **Ancillary cap calculation** | Workings showing 50% test |
| **Strategic management** | Board minutes, management presence evidence |
| **Cost allocation** | Methodology for attributing costs to shipping vs non-shipping |

### Cost Allocation Methodology

All **direct and indirect costs** attributable to shipping income must also be excluded. Document your allocation methodology:

| Cost Type | Allocation Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Direct vessel costs | 100% to shipping income |
| Crew costs | By vessel assignment |
| Shared overheads | Revenue-based or time-based allocation |
| Finance costs | By asset financed |

## 8. Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Assuming All Tonnage Tax Income Is Excluded

**Error:** Treating all income qualifying for domestic tonnage tax as excluded under Article 3.3.

**Problem:** GloBE has narrower definition; domestic coastal and certain activities remain in scope.

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring the 50% Ancillary Cap

**Error:** Excluding all ancillary income without checking the 50% limit.

**Problem:** Excess ancillary income remains in GloBE Income.

### Pitfall 3: Forgetting Loss Exclusion Symmetry

**Error:** Allowing shipping losses to reduce other GloBE Income.

**Problem:** Losses must be excluded alongside income; no cherry-picking.

### Pitfall 4: Insufficient Strategic Management Evidence

**Error:** Claiming exclusion for ships managed from another jurisdiction.

**Problem:** Exclusion denied if strategic management not in CE's jurisdiction.

### Pitfall 5: Misclassifying Inland Waterway Transport

**Error:** Treating river barge operations as international shipping.

**Problem:** Inland waterways within same jurisdiction are explicitly excluded.

The international shipping exclusion rewards groups that structure their maritime operations thoughtfully, maintain genuine substance in shipping jurisdictions, and understand the precise boundaries of qualifying activities. It is not a blanket exemption for anything labelled "shipping" but a carefully circumscribed carve-out for traditional oceangoing transport and closely related ancillary activities. Groups entering or expanding in the maritime sector should build Pillar Two analysis into their structuring from the outset, ensuring that new activities are classified correctly and that strategic management requirements can be satisfied where exclusion is sought. For existing operators, a comprehensive mapping exercise—comparing current structures against Article 3.3's requirements—is an essential first step in managing Pillar Two exposure.

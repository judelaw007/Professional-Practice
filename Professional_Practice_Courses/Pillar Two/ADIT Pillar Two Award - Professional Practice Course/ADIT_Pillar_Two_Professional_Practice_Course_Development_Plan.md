# ADIT Pillar Two Professional Practice Course
## Development Plan and Guidance

---

## Course Overview

**Course Title:** ADIT Pillar Two Professional Practice Course: Implementation Guide for Tax Professionals

**Target Audience:** Tax advisors, in-house tax professionals, and compliance specialists at MNE groups who need to implement Pillar Two/GloBE rules in practice.

**Course Duration:** 20-25 hours of core content (structured as self-paced learning)

**Prerequisites:**
- Working knowledge of international tax concepts
- Familiarity with consolidated financial statements
- Basic understanding of the Pillar Two framework (definitions assumed known)

---

## Course Philosophy

This Professional Practice Course transforms the ADIT Pillar Two Award syllabus into an **implementation-focused training programme**.

**What this course is:**
- A step-by-step implementation guide for Pillar Two compliance
- A practical resource with tools, templates, and worked examples
- A hands-on training programme with progressive case studies

**What this course is NOT:**
- A textbook explaining what Pillar Two is or its history
- An academic analysis of policy rationale
- A definitions and concepts primer

**Core Principle:** Practitioners taking this course already know WHAT Pillar Two is. This course teaches them HOW to implement it.

---

## Course Structure

The course is organised into **8 Parts**, aligned with the ADIT syllabus sections but restructured around practitioner workflows. Case studies appear **at the end of each Part** where hands-on practice adds genuine value—they are not included merely for the sake of having them.

### Progressive Storyline: GlobalTech Industries

Throughout this course, learners follow **GlobalTech Industries**, a fictional multinational enterprise, through its first Pillar Two compliance cycle. The scenario evolves across Parts, building complexity as learners develop skills.

### Tools for Part 8

**No tools required for Part 8.**

This Part is policy and framework-focused with limited calculation content. STTR calculations are treaty-specific and rarely performed. Instead:
- **External Resource Links:** Direct links to OECD's official jurisdiction status trackers
- **Worked STTR Example:** Single comprehensive example shown inline in content
- **Practical Exercise:** Staying current with administrative guidance (replaces case study)

### Case Study Consideration for Part 8

**Note:** Part 8 is primarily policy and framework-focused. A full case study is **not included** here as the content does not lend itself to hands-on calculation practice in the same way as Parts 1-7.

Instead, Part 8 concludes with a **practical exercise**:

**Practical Exercise 8: Staying Current**
- Task: Using the official OECD resources, identify any administrative guidance issued in the past 6 months relevant to GlobalTech's Pillar Two compliance
- Deliverable: Summary memo of guidance updates and their impact on GlobalTech's calculations or elections

This exercise reinforces the practitioner's ability to monitor and incorporate evolving guidance without forcing a case study where one doesn't naturally fit.

## Tool Requirements: Critical Analysis

### The Gate Question

Before proposing any tool, we must answer: **"If this tool didn't exist, what would the learner miss?"**

If the answer is vague or the skill can be adequately learned through worked examples in the content, **no tool is needed**.

| GIR-006 | Audit File Checklist | Part 7 | Audit documentation checklist for GloBE compliance |

**Key insight:** GIR-001 is a consolidated tool that handles ETR, SBIE, and Top-Up Tax in one integrated 3-step workflow. It takes GloBE Income and Adjusted Covered Taxes as inputs—the adjustment process to derive these figures is taught in content, not through a separate tool.

### Part-by-Part Tool Analysis

#### Part 1: Scope Determination
**Proposed tools eliminated:** MNE Scope Assessment Tool, Revenue Threshold Calculator, Entity Classification Tool

**Gate Question Analysis:**
- Revenue threshold calculation is a straightforward arithmetic exercise (sum revenues, compare to €750M)
- Entity classification follows a decision tree that is better shown as a flowchart in content
- Scope determination is a one-time analytical exercise, not a skill requiring repeated practice

**Decision:** **NO TOOLS NEEDED**
- Use inline flowcharts and decision trees in content
- Provide a comprehensive checklist learners can use with their own data
- The worked example (GlobalTech) demonstrates the process sufficiently

---

#### Part 2: Charging Mechanism (IIR/UTPR)
**Proposed tools eliminated:** IIR Allocation Calculator, UTPR Allocation Calculator, Charging Rule Navigator

**Gate Question Analysis:**
- IIR allocation follows ownership percentages - straightforward multiplication
- UTPR allocation uses a formula (employees + assets) - can be shown in worked examples
- Ordering rules are logic-based, not calculation-based

**Decision:** **REUSE GIR-001 (GloBE Calculator)**
- GIR-001 Step 3 handles the top-up tax calculation that feeds into allocation
- Allocation itself is arithmetic that doesn't benefit from a separate tool
- Use decision matrices and flowcharts in content for ordering rules

---

#### Part 3: GloBE Income Calculation
**Proposed tools eliminated:** GloBE Income Calculator, Adjustment Tracker, PE Income Allocator

**Gate Question Analysis:**
- GloBE Income calculation involves 25+ adjustment types
- GIR-001 takes GloBE Income as an input—the adjustment process is preparatory
- The adjustments are primarily classification decisions (include/exclude), not complex calculations
- A detailed checklist with worked examples in content achieves the same learning outcome

**Decision:** **NO NEW TOOL NEEDED**
- Provide comprehensive adjustment checklist in content (25+ items)
- Show complete worked example with actual numbers for each adjustment type
- Case Study 3 walks through the full process
- Learners derive GloBE Income manually, then enter into GIR-001 for calculation practice

**Content provides:** Adjustment checklist + worked example + case study walkthrough

---

#### Part 4: Covered Taxes
**Proposed tools eliminated:** Covered Tax Calculator, DTA Tracker, Tax Allocation Tool

**Gate Question Analysis:**
- Covered tax identification is primarily classification (yes/no for each tax type)
- DTA tracking is a multi-year record-keeping exercise, not a calculation skill
- Tax allocation follows defined rules that can be shown in worked examples

**Decision:** **REUSE GIR-001 (ETR Calculator)**
- GIR-001 takes Adjusted Covered Taxes as an input
- Similar to Part 3, the value is understanding HOW to derive the input
- A checklist format in content is more appropriate than a tool

**If Part 3 tool is built:** Consider whether it should also include Covered Tax adjustments, creating a unified "GloBE Computation Worksheet" that feeds into GIR-001

---

#### Part 5: ETR and Top-Up Tax
**Proposed tools eliminated:** De Minimis Assessment Tool (simple threshold check)

**Decision:** **REUSE GIR-001 (GloBE Calculator)**
- GIR-001 provides complete coverage with its integrated 3-step workflow:
  - Step 1: ETR calculation
  - Step 2: SBIE calculation
  - Step 3: Top-Up Tax computation

One tool covers all Part 5 calculation needs. No new tools needed.

---

#### Part 6: Special Structures and Restructurings
**Proposed tools eliminated:** M&A Impact Assessor, JV Calculator, Election Tracker

**Gate Question Analysis:**
- M&A impact assessment is highly fact-dependent - each situation is different
- JV calculations follow the same ETR/top-up methodology (use existing tools)
- Election tracking is administrative record-keeping, not a learnable skill

**Decision:** **NO NEW TOOLS NEEDED**
- JV scenarios can use GIR-001 (GloBE Calculator) with JV-specific data inputs
- M&A impacts are better taught through detailed worked examples
- Provide an election checklist in content (not a tool)

---

#### Part 7: Compliance and Filing
**Proposed tools eliminated:** Data Mapping Tool (reference material, not a practice tool)

**Decision:** **REUSE EXISTING TOOLS**
- GIR-002: Safe Harbour Qualifier - pre-screening for safe harbour eligibility
- GIR-003: Filing Deadline Calculator - deadline calculation
- GIR-004: GIR Practice Form - interactive filing practice
- GIR-005: DFE Assessment Tool - filing entity election guidance
- GIR-006: Audit File Checklist - documentation requirements

These five tools provide comprehensive coverage for compliance and filing practice.

---

#### Part 8: STTR and Inclusive Framework
**Proposed tools eliminated:** STTR Impact Calculator, Jurisdiction Status Tracker

**Gate Question Analysis:**
- STTR calculations are treaty-specific and rarely performed by most practitioners
- Jurisdiction status is reference information that changes frequently - better as web links to OECD tracker
- This Part is policy-focused with limited calculation content

**Decision:** **NO TOOLS NEEDED**
- Link to OECD's official jurisdiction trackers (external resource)
- STTR impact analysis is better taught through worked examples
- Practical exercise (not case study) is sufficient for this Part

### Consolidated Tool Summary

| Category | Tool | Status | Used In |
|----------|------|--------|---------|
| **REUSE** | GIR-001 GloBE Calculator | Existing (tools.mojitax.com) | Parts 2, 4, 5, 6 |
| **REUSE** | GIR-002 Safe Harbour Qualifier | Existing (tools.mojitax.com) | Part 7 |
| **REUSE** | GIR-003 Filing Deadline Calculator | Existing (tools.mojitax.com) | Part 7 |
| **REUSE** | GIR-004 GIR Practice Form | Existing (tools.mojitax.com) | Part 7 |
| **REUSE** | GIR-005 DFE Assessment Tool | Existing (tools.mojitax.com) | Part 7 |
| **REUSE** | GIR-006 Audit File Checklist | Existing (tools.mojitax.com) | Part 7 |

**Result: 6 existing tools reused, 0 new tools needed**

This represents a reduction from 24 originally proposed tools to 0 new tools, by:
1. Recognising that GIR-001 is an integrated 3-step calculator (ETR → SBIE → Top-Up Tax)
2. Applying the Gate Question rigorously to eliminate unnecessary tools
3. Using flowcharts, checklists, and worked examples in content where tools don't add value

---

### Why No New Tools Are Needed

**Part 3 (GloBE Income Calculation) - Reconsidered:**

The original analysis suggested a GloBE Income Adjustment Calculator might be needed. On further reflection:

- GIR-001 takes GloBE Income as an input—the adjustment process is **preparatory work**
- The 25+ adjustments are classification decisions (include/exclude) more than calculations
- A detailed **adjustment checklist** in content with worked examples serves the same learning purpose
- Learners enter the final GloBE Income figure into GIR-001, which then performs the ETR/SBIE/Top-Up Tax calculations

**What content provides instead of a tool:**
- Comprehensive adjustment checklist (25+ items with yes/no criteria)
- Worked example showing each adjustment type with actual numbers
- Case Study 3 walks through the complete process step-by-step
- The output feeds into GIR-001 for practice with the calculation workflow

### What Replaces Tools in Each Part

For Parts where no tools are specified, the content must include robust alternatives:

| Part | Instead of Tools | Content Approach |
|------|------------------|------------------|
| Part 1 | Scope Assessment | Decision flowchart, comprehensive checklist, worked example |
| Part 2 | Allocation Calculators | Allocation formulas with worked examples, decision matrix for ordering rules |
| Part 4 | Covered Tax Calculator | Classification checklist, adjustment examples shown inline |
| Part 6 | M&A/JV Tools | Detailed worked examples showing how existing tools apply to special structures |
| Part 8 | STTR Calculator | Links to OECD trackers, worked STTR example in content |

## Conclusion

This development plan transforms the ADIT Pillar Two Award syllabus into a true Professional Practice Course by:

1. **Reorganising content** around practitioner workflows rather than regulatory structure
2. **Focusing on implementation** with step-by-step processes and calculations
3. **Integrating tools** for hands-on practice throughout the course
4. **Using progressive case studies** that build skills across the GlobalTech storyline
5. **Embedding official resources** directly where practitioners need them
6. **Placing case studies strategically** at the end of each Part where practice adds genuine value

The result is a course that enables practitioners to **implement Pillar Two compliance immediately**, not just understand the rules theoretically.

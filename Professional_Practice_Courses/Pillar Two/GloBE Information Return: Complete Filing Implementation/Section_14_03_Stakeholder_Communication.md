# Section 14.3: Stakeholder Communication

## Overview

Effective stakeholder communication is critical to successful GloBE Information Return (GIR) implementation. Pillar Two requires unprecedented cross-functional collaboration, with data and input needed from tax, finance, IT, HR, legal, and local entity teams across multiple jurisdictions. This section provides guidance on communicating with key stakeholders and templates for essential communications.

**Key Research Findings:**
- 91% of large organisations expect to be impacted by Pillar Two, yet only 43% of tax professionals feel ready (PwC Global Reframing Tax Survey 2025)
- 77% of respondents anticipate difficulties in obtaining the necessary data (Wolters Kluwer BEPS Pillar Two Readiness Survey)
- 83% of respondents need moderate to significant adjustments to source data (EY TFO Survey 2024)
- Cross-functional collaboration across tax, finance, IT, and HR is vital for success

## 14.3.2 Board and Audit Committee Communication

### Why Board Engagement Matters

Tax leaders must educate the CFO, audit committee, and board on the magnitude of Pillar Two, why it matters to them, and their roles in the MNE's operational readiness. Pillar Two represents one of the most significant changes to international tax in decades, with potential impacts on:

- Global effective tax rate (ETR)
- Financial statement disclosures (IAS 12 amendments)
- Compliance costs and resource requirements
- Strategic planning and investment decisions

### Board Briefing Content

#### Executive Summary Elements:

| Topic | Key Messages |
|-------|--------------|
| **What is Pillar Two?** | Global minimum 15% ETR for MNEs with €750M+ revenue |
| **Why does it matter?** | Mandatory compliance, potential top-up tax, disclosure requirements |
| **What is the GIR?** | Standardized information return, ~480 data points, filed in multiple jurisdictions |
| **Timeline** | First filing: June 30, 2026 (for FY ending Dec 2024) |
| **Resource requirements** | Cross-functional team, technology investment, potential advisory support |
| **Financial impact** | Estimated top-up tax exposure, compliance costs |
| **Risks** | Data quality, deadline pressure, regulatory change |

#### Recommended Board Actions:

1. Approve resource allocation for GIR implementation
2. Designate executive sponsor (typically CFO)
3. Receive quarterly progress updates
4. Review and approve financial statement disclosures
5. Understand penalty exposure for non-compliance

- Section 2: Safe Harbour Elections and Exclusions
- Section 3: GloBE Computations (ETR calculation, top-up tax)

3. SCOPE AND IMPACT

[Insert company-specific details:]
- Number of jurisdictions: ___

## 14.3.3 CFO Engagement

### The CFO's Critical Role

A successful Pillar Two transformation requires the CFO to engage leaders within their organization by setting the tone from the top, as different stakeholders need to understand their new responsibilities. The CFO must understand:

- Impact on global ETR and financial statements
- Compliance costs and resource requirements
- Cross-functional coordination needs
- Technology investment requirements
- External disclosure implications

### CFO Communication Approach

| Phase | CFO Engagement Focus |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Initiation** | Sponsorship commitment, resource authorization |
| **Planning** | Budget approval, stakeholder prioritization |
| **Execution** | Issue escalation, progress monitoring |
| **Filing** | Final approval, disclosure sign-off |
| **Ongoing** | Annual compliance oversight, process improvement |

### Key CFO Questions to Address

| Question | Recommended Response Approach |
|----------|------------------------------|
| "What's our exposure?" | Provide top-up tax range estimate with assumptions |
| "What will this cost?" | Present total cost of compliance (internal + external + technology) |
| "Who's responsible?" | Clarify RACI and confirm tax as accountable, CFO as sponsor |
| "What are the risks?" | Outline penalty exposure, reputational risk, timeline risk |
| "What do you need from me?" | Specific asks: budget, cross-functional authority, escalation support |

---

## 14.3.4 Finance Team Coordination

### Finance Team Data Requirements

Pillar Two calculations start with financial accounting, not tax data—a fundamental shift. Finance leaders must be at the table from day one, providing:

| Data Type | Source | Finance Team Owner |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Financial Accounting Net Income/Loss | Statutory accounts | Financial Controller |
| Revenue by jurisdiction | Management accounts | FP&A |
| Tangible asset values | Fixed asset register | Fixed Assets Manager |
| Currency conversion rates | Treasury | Treasury Manager |
| Consolidation adjustments | HFM/consolidation | Consolidation Accountant |
| Intercompany eliminations | Consolidation | Consolidation Accountant |

## 14.3.6 HR/Payroll Communication

The Substance-Based Income Exclusion (SBIE) provides a carve-out based on payroll expenses and tangible assets. For payroll, this requires:

FROM:       [Group Tax Director]
CC:         CFO, CHRO
DATE:       [Date]
SUBJECT:    Urgent Data Request – Pillar Two SBIE Payroll Information

Dear Colleagues,

We require payroll data from HR/Payroll systems to calculate the
Substance-Based Income Exclusion (SBIE) under the Pillar Two global minimum
tax rules. This carve-out directly reduces our potential top-up tax liability.

BACKGROUND

The SBIE allows a deduction from taxable profits based on:
- 9.8% of eligible payroll costs (2024, declining to 5% by 2033)
- 7.8% of eligible tangible assets (2024, declining to 5% by 2033)

Accurate payroll data is essential to maximize this exclusion and minimize
top-up tax.

DATA REQUIRED

For each constituent entity, for fiscal year [2024]:

1. ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEE PAYROLL COSTS
   - Total compensation (salaries, wages, bonuses)
   - Employer pension/retirement contributions
   - Employer payroll taxes and social security
   - Other taxable fringe benefits

   Note: Exclude independent contractors not under MNE direction/control

2. EMPLOYEE LOCATION DATA
   - Number of employees by jurisdiction
   - For mobile employees: percentage of time in each jurisdiction
   - Entity of employment vs physical work location

3. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
   - Share-based payment expense per financial accounts
   - By entity and jurisdiction

4. EXCLUDED AMOUNTS
   - Payroll costs capitalized into tangible assets
   - Payroll related to excluded income (e.g., shipping)

DATA FORMAT

Please provide data in the attached template [Excel template attached] by
entity and jurisdiction.

MOBILE EMPLOYEES – SPECIAL ATTENTION

For employees working in multiple jurisdictions:
- If >50% of time in one jurisdiction: allocate 100% to that jurisdiction
- If ≤50% in any single jurisdiction: pro-rata allocation based on time

We need specific data for internationally mobile employees to ensure correct
allocation.

## 14.3.7 External Auditor Notification

## Summary

Effective stakeholder communication is fundamental to GIR implementation success. Key takeaways:

1. **Engage early:** Cross-functional awareness prevents last-minute surprises
2. **Tailor messages:** Different stakeholders need different information
3. **Set clear expectations:** Deadlines, deliverables, and consequences must be explicit
4. **Provide support:** Training, templates, and Q&A reduce friction
5. **Maintain momentum:** Regular updates keep stakeholders engaged
6. **Document everything:** Written communications create accountability and audit trail

**Critical Success Factor:** The CFO must set the tone from the top, ensuring different stakeholders understand their new responsibilities and make them a priority. Without executive sponsorship and cross-functional authority, tax teams struggle to obtain the data needed for accurate, timely GIR completion.

**Next Steps:** Proceed to Section 14.4 (Go-Live Checklist) for the final pre-submission verification procedures.

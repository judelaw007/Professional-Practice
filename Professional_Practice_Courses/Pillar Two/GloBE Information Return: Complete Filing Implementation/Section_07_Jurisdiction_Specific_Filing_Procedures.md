# Section 7: Jurisdiction-Specific Filing Procedures

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Understand the common elements of GIR filing across all implementing jurisdictions
- Navigate the key differences in registration, filing, and payment requirements
- Identify the critical deadlines applicable to your filing jurisdiction
- Apply the Multi-Jurisdiction Filing Coordination Checklist for groups with multiple filing obligations

## Introduction

While the OECD GloBE Information Return provides a standardised framework for Pillar Two reporting, the actual filing process varies by jurisdiction. Each country has implemented its own registration requirements, portal systems, language requirements, and amendment procedures.

This section provides a practical overview of filing procedures across key jurisdictions, presented through comparative tables that highlight similarities and differences. The goal is to equip practitioners with sufficient general knowledge to navigate any jurisdiction's requirements, while recognising that detailed procedural knowledge will be acquired when working within a specific jurisdiction.

**Key Principle:** Most practitioners will file GIR in a single jurisdiction on behalf of their MNE Group. The value of understanding multiple jurisdictions lies not in detailed procedural expertise, but in appreciating how requirements differ and ensuring proper coordination when a group has filing obligations in multiple countries.

## 7.1 Common Filing Framework

### Universal Elements Across All Jurisdictions

Despite local variations, all GIR filing procedures share common elements derived from the OECD framework:

| Element | Universal Requirement |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Threshold** | Consolidated revenue ≥ €750 million in at least 2 of the last 4 fiscal years |
| **Standard Deadline** | 15 months after fiscal year end |
| **First-Year Extension** | 18 months for the first year in scope |
| **XML Format** | OECD GIR XML Schema v1.0 (January 2025) |
| **Content** | Standardised across all jurisdictions per OECD specification |
| **Exchange** | Automatic exchange via GIR MCAA between signatories |

### Filing Deadline Calculation

For calendar year-end groups first in scope for FY 2024:

```
Deadline Calculation:
│
├── Fiscal Year End: 31 December 2024
│
├── Standard Deadline (15 months): 31 March 2026
│
├── First-Year Extension (+3 months): 30 June 2026
│
└── Filing Deadline: 30 June 2026
```

For non-calendar year-end groups, adjust accordingly:

| Fiscal Year End | Standard (15 months) | First-Year (18 months) |
|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| 31 March 2025 | 30 June 2026 | 30 September 2026 |
| 30 June 2025 | 30 September 2026 | 31 December 2026 |
| 30 September 2025 | 31 December 2026 | 31 March 2027 |

## 7.3 Key Jurisdiction Highlights

### United Kingdom

The UK requires both GIR submission and a UK Self-Assessment Return for Pillar 2 taxes:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Registration** | Mandatory via GOV.UK within 6 months of first period end |
| **Filing Member** | UPE by default; can nominate alternative group member |
| **GIR Submission** | Via HMRC digital service (API or portal) |
| **Overseas Return Notification (ORN)** | Required if GIR filed in another jurisdiction and exchanged via MCAA |
| **UK Self-Assessment** | Separate return for MTT/DTT liability, required regardless of GIR location |
| **Agent Access** | Agents cannot register on behalf of MNE; must be done by group company |

**UK-Specific Considerations:**
- UTPR effective for periods starting on or after 31 December 2024
- HMRC Pillar 2 ID generated upon registration—required for all submissions
- Telephone support available 08:30-17:00 Monday-Friday

### Germany

Germany requires three separate filings for Pillar Two compliance:

| Filing | Deadline | Authority |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Group Head Notification** | 2 months after tax period end (28 Feb 2025 for calendar year) | BZSt |
| **GloBE Information Return** | 30 June 2026 (first year) | BZSt |
| **Minimum Tax Return** | 30 June 2026 (first year) | State tax office (Finanzamt) |

**Germany-Specific Considerations:**
- Group head notification is a prerequisite for GIR filing
- Minimum tax return filed separately to the responsible state tax office
- Germany signed GIR MCAA in September 2025

### Netherlands

The Netherlands separates GIR filing from top-up tax payment:

| Requirement | Deadline (FY 2024) |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **GIR Filing** | 1 July 2026 (18 months) |
| **Top-Up Tax Return** | 31 August 2026 (20 months) |
| **Top-Up Tax Payment** | With return (31 August 2026) |

**Netherlands-Specific Considerations:**
- Signed GIR MCAA in August 2025
- QDMTT uses local accounting standards (IFRS, Dutch GAAP)
- Clear separation of information return from tax liability return

### Ireland

Ireland has established a dedicated Pillar Two Hub:

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Portal Launch** | 14 August 2025 |
| **Registration Deadline** | 31 December 2025 |
| **Integration** | Linked to Revenue Online Service (ROS) |
| **QDMTT** | Uses local accounting standard rule |

**Ireland-Specific Considerations:**
- 12.5% headline rate means QDMTT likely to apply for many Irish CEs
- Detailed Revenue guidance issued September 2025
- Penalties will be imposed for non-registration

### Australia

Australia enacted Pillar Two legislation in December 2024:

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Royal Assent** | 10 December 2024 |
| **IIR Effective** | 1 January 2024 |
| **UTPR Effective** | 1 January 2025 |
| **Record Retention** | 8 years |

**Australia-Specific Considerations:**
- Subordinate legislation published 23 December 2024
- Domestic hybrid mismatch rules continue to apply
- ATO guidance updated November 2025

### Singapore

Singapore implementation begins for FY 2025:

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Effective Date** | Financial years starting on or after 1 January 2025 |
| **Domestic Top-Up Tax** | Yes |
| **IIR Regime** | Transitional qualified status awarded |

**Singapore-Specific Considerations:**
- One year behind most jurisdictions (FY 2025 vs FY 2024)
- Parliament considering amendments to technical definitions
- Strong existing digital infrastructure via IRAS

## 7.4 Implementation Status Overview

The following table summarises Pillar Two implementation status across key jurisdictions as of late 2025:

| Jurisdiction | IIR | UTPR | QDMTT | Legislation Status | First GIR Due |
|--------------|-----|------|-------|-------------------|---------------|
| **United Kingdom** | FY 2024 | FY 2025 | FY 2024 | Enacted | 30 June 2026 |

| **France** | FY 2024 | FY 2025 | FY 2024 | Enacted | 30 June 2026 |
| **Italy** | FY 2024 | FY 2025 | FY 2024 | Enacted | 30 June 2026 |
| **Spain** | FY 2024 | FY 2025 | FY 2024 | Enacted | 30 June 2026 |
| **Australia** | FY 2024 | FY 2025 | - | Enacted | 30 June 2026 |
| **Singapore** | FY 2025 | FY 2025 | FY 2025 | Enacted | 30 June 2027 |
| **Japan** | FY 2024 | FY 2025 | FY 2024 | Enacted | 30 June 2026 |
| **South Korea** | FY 2024 | FY 2025 | FY 2024 | Enacted | 30 June 2026 |
| **Canada** | FY 2024 | FY 2025 | FY 2024 | Enacted | 30 June 2026 |
| **Switzerland** | FY 2024 | FY 2025 | FY 2024 | Enacted | 30 June 2026 |
| **Luxembourg** | FY 2024 | FY 2025 | FY 2024 | Enacted | 30 June 2026 |
| **United States** | Not implemented | Not implemented | Not implemented | No legislation | N/A |

**Note:** The United States has not enacted Pillar Two legislation. US-parented MNE Groups remain subject to IIR/UTPR in other jurisdictions where they have constituent entities.

---

## 7.5 GIR MCAA Signatories

The GloBE Information Return Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (GIR MCAA) enables automatic exchange of GIR data between jurisdictions. Key signatories as of late 2025:

| Signatory | Signature Date |
|-----------|---------------|
| United Kingdom | February 2025 |
| Netherlands | August 2025 |
| Germany | September 2025 |
| Norway | September 2025 |
| Liechtenstein | September 2025 |
| Ireland | 2025 |
| France | 2025 |
| Australia | 2025 |
| Canada | 2025 |
| Japan | 2025 |
| South Korea | 2025 |

**Current Total:** 18+ signatories (as of September 2025)

**Implication:** If your jurisdiction is a GIR MCAA signatory and you file the GIR there, other signatory jurisdictions should receive the relevant data automatically. This may reduce (but not eliminate) local filing requirements in those other jurisdictions.

## 7.6 Practical Filing Guidance

### Step-by-Step Filing Process (Generic)

Regardless of jurisdiction, the GIR filing process follows a common pattern:

```
Generic GIR Filing Process:
│
├── Phase 1: REGISTRATION
│   ├── Identify filing jurisdiction(s)
│   ├── Determine filing entity (UPE or DFE)
│   ├── Register with relevant tax authority
│   ├── Obtain unique identifier/reference number
│   └── Note: Registration deadlines vary by jurisdiction
│
├── Phase 2: PREPARATION
│   ├── Complete GIR Calculator
│   ├── Generate GIR XML file
│   ├── Validate against OECD schema
│   ├── Obtain internal approvals
│   └── Record file hash for integrity
│
├── Phase 3: SUBMISSION
│   ├── Log in to tax authority portal
│   ├── Upload validated XML file
│   ├── Complete any supplementary forms
│   ├── Submit and obtain confirmation
│   └── Save receipt/reference number
│
├── Phase 4: PAYMENT (if applicable)
│   ├── Calculate top-up tax liability
│   ├── Complete tax return (if separate from GIR)
│   ├── Make payment by deadline
│   └── Retain payment confirmation
│
└── Phase 5: POST-FILING
    ├── Monitor for authority queries
    ├── File in other jurisdictions if required
    ├── Submit ORN/notification if GIR filed elsewhere
    └── Archive all documentation
```

### Common Portal Features

Most tax authority portals share similar functionality:

| Feature | Typical Implementation |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Authentication** | Government gateway, digital certificate, or MFA |
| **File Upload** | XML file selection and upload |
| **Validation** | Real-time schema validation with error messages |
| **Confirmation** | Reference number and downloadable receipt |
| **Amendment** | Correction submission with reference to original |
| **History** | View previously submitted returns |

### Technical Requirements

Ensure your systems meet common portal requirements:

| Requirement | Typical Specification |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Browser** | Chrome, Edge, Firefox (latest versions) |
| **File Format** | XML per OECD GIR Schema v1.0 |
| **File Size** | Typically 10-50 MB limit |
| **Encoding** | UTF-8 (no BOM) |
| **Connection** | Secure HTTPS |
| **Certificates** | May require digital certificate for authentication |

## 7.7 Multi-Jurisdiction Filing Coordination

### When Multi-Jurisdiction Filing Applies

Multi-jurisdiction filing coordination is required when:
- The MNE Group has constituent entities in multiple implementing jurisdictions
- Different jurisdictions require local filing beyond the primary GIR
- The UPE jurisdiction differs from the filing jurisdiction
- QDMTT applies in multiple jurisdictions

### Coordination Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Single GIR** | One GIR covers the entire MNE Group globally |
| **Primary Filing Jurisdiction** | Typically UPE jurisdiction or designated filing jurisdiction |
| **MCAA Exchange** | Primary GIR shared with MCAA signatories automatically |
| **Local Requirements** | Some jurisdictions require additional local returns despite MCAA |
| **Consistency** | Data must be consistent across all jurisdictions |

### Multi-Jurisdiction Filing Coordination Checklist

| Element | Typical Approach |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Trigger** | Material error discovered post-submission |
| **Method** | New XML file with amendment indicator set |
| **Reference** | Link to original MessageRefID |
| **Explanation** | Written explanation of changes typically required |
| **Deadline** | Varies; some jurisdictions have specific amendment windows |

### Jurisdiction Amendment Comparison

| Jurisdiction | Amendment Method | Time Limit | Supporting Documentation |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------------|
| **United Kingdom** | Amended return via portal | Per HMRC guidance | Explanation may be requested |
| **Germany** | Corrected GIR + amended tax return | Per AO provisions | Written explanation required |
| **Netherlands** | Amended GIR via portal | Within statutory period | Supporting documentation advised |
| **Ireland** | Amended return via ROS | Per Revenue guidance | Explanation required |
| **France** | Rectificative declaration | Per CGI provisions | Supporting documentation |
| **Australia** | Amended lodgement | Per ATO guidance | Explanation may be required |

### Amendment Coordination

When amending a GIR that affects multiple jurisdictions:
1. Prepare single amended GIR with corrected data
2. Submit to primary filing jurisdiction
3. Notify secondary jurisdictions of amendment (ORN update if applicable)
4. Ensure local top-up tax returns reflect corrections
5. Document all amendments in central tracking log

## 7.9 Key Takeaways

### Summary of Critical Points

1. **Universal Framework, Local Execution**
   - OECD provides the standard; jurisdictions implement locally
   - Same GIR XML schema used globally
   - Filing portals, deadlines, and supplementary requirements vary

2. **Registration is Prerequisite**
   - Most jurisdictions require registration before filing
   - Registration deadlines often earlier than GIR filing deadlines
   - Failure to register may trigger penalties

3. **First-Year Extension Applies Broadly**
   - 18 months instead of 15 months for first year in scope
   - 30 June 2026 for most calendar year-end groups (FY 2024)

4. **MCAA Reduces (But Doesn't Eliminate) Duplication**
   - GIR filed once, exchanged automatically to signatories
   - Local notifications (ORN in UK) may still be required
   - Local top-up tax returns typically still required

5. **Transitional Penalty Relief Available**
   - OECD guidance recommends leniency for first three years
   - "Reasonable measures" standard for early adopters
   - Document compliance efforts for potential penalty discussions

6. **Coordination Essential for Multi-Jurisdiction Groups**
   - Single source of truth for GIR data
   - Consistent messaging across all jurisdictions
   - Central tracking of all filing obligations

# Section 14.2: Resource Requirements

## Overview

This section provides detailed guidance on the resources required for successful GloBE Information Return (GIR) implementation, including internal team composition, time allocation, external advisor engagement, and technology requirements. Proper resource planning is critical—Pillar Two compliance represents one of the most significant changes to international tax compliance in decades.

**Key Research Findings:**
- Tax Foundation estimates additional compliance costs for European MNEs at EUR 1.2-2.0 billion (one-time) and EUR 517-865 million annually (recurring)
- 70% of companies expect to pay in excess of US$500,000 annually for Pillar Two compliance
- Only 40-60% of required data typically resides in ERP systems
- Cross-functional collaboration is essential—tax alone cannot deliver compliance

## 14.2.1 Internal Team Composition

### Core Team Structure

Pillar Two is more than just a tax issue. Responsibility for complying with this new regime requires resources beyond the traditional tax function, including financial reporting controllers, IT/systems, human resources, and other corporate stakeholders.

| **GIR Project Sponsor** | Executive oversight, resource authorization, escalation decisions | Senior leadership, stakeholder management |
| **Project Manager** | Timeline management, cross-functional coordination, status reporting | Project management, communication |
| **GIR Technical Lead** | GIR completion, XML generation, technical accuracy | Pillar Two expertise, tax technical |
| **Data Manager** | Data mapping, extraction coordination, validation | Data management, systems knowledge |
| **Entity Coordinator** | Local data collection, entity communications | Multi-jurisdiction coordination |

#### Extended Team Roles:

| Role | Department | Contribution |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **Financial Controller** | Finance | Financial statement data, accounting adjustments |
| **Tax Provision Lead** | Tax | Covered taxes data, deferred tax adjustments |
| **Transfer Pricing Manager** | Tax | Intra-group transaction data, adjustments |
| **ERP/Systems Lead** | IT | Data extraction, system access, technical support |
| **HR/Payroll Lead** | HR | Payroll data by jurisdiction for SBIE |
| **Fixed Assets Manager** | Finance | Tangible asset data by location for SBIE |
| **Legal/Company Secretary** | Legal | Entity structure, ownership documentation |
| **Treasury Manager** | Treasury | FX rates, intercompany financing data |

---

### Team Size by Organization Complexity

Team requirements scale based on MNE group complexity:

#### Small MNE Group (10-30 jurisdictions, 50-150 entities)

| Role | FTE Allocation | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Project Manager | 0.3-0.5 | Can be combined with Technical Lead |
| GIR Technical Lead | 0.5-1.0 | Core delivery role |
| Data Manager | 0.3-0.5 | May share with other projects |
| Entity Coordinator | 0.3-0.5 | Regional coordination |
| Extended team support | 0.5-1.0 | Combined allocation |
| **Total Core FTE** | **2.0-3.5** | |

#### Medium MNE Group (30-60 jurisdictions, 150-400 entities)

| Role | FTE Allocation | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Project Manager | 0.5-0.75 | Dedicated coordination |
| GIR Technical Lead | 1.0-1.5 | May need deputy |
| Data Manager | 0.5-1.0 | Significant data workload |
| Entity Coordinators | 1.0-2.0 | Multiple regional coordinators |
| Extended team support | 1.0-2.0 | Combined allocation |
| **Total Core FTE** | **4.0-7.0** | |

#### Large MNE Group (60+ jurisdictions, 400+ entities)

| Role | FTE Allocation | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| Project Manager | 0.75-1.0 | Full-time dedicated |
| GIR Technical Lead | 1.5-2.0 | Team of specialists |
| Data Manager | 1.0-1.5 | Full-time data focus |
| Entity Coordinators | 2.0-4.0 | Regional team leads |
| Extended team support | 2.0-3.0 | Dedicated support |
| **Total Core FTE** | **7.0-11.5** | |

**Note:** FTE figures represent annualized allocation. Peak periods (Month 3-5 of implementation timeline) may require 50-100% higher capacity.

### Key Skills Requirements

#### Technical Tax Skills:
- Pillar Two / GloBE Rules expertise
- Understanding of IIR, UTPR, and QDMTT mechanics
- ETR calculation methodology
- Safe harbour provisions knowledge
- Multi-jurisdiction tax compliance experience

#### Data and Technology Skills:
- Data mapping and transformation
- ERP system knowledge (SAP, Oracle, etc.)
- Excel advanced functionality (Power Query, macros)
- XML schema understanding
- Data validation techniques

#### Project Management Skills:
- Cross-functional team coordination
- Stakeholder communication
- Risk management
- Timeline and resource management
- Change management

**Skills Gap Alert:** According to Deloitte research, finding professionals with tax subject matter expertise is one of the top three challenges facing tax departments across Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific. Many organizations now seek "hybrid" tax specialists who combine tax knowledge with data analytics and technology capabilities.

## 14.2.7 Resource Optimization Strategies

### Leverage Safe Harbours

Safe harbour elections can significantly reduce resource requirements:

| Safe Harbour | Resource Impact |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Transitional CbCR Safe Harbour** | Reduces Section 3 data requirements for qualifying jurisdictions |
| **QDMTT Safe Harbour** | May reduce calculation complexity in qualifying jurisdictions |
| **De Minimis Exclusion** | Reduces entity-level data requirements |

**Recommendation:** Conduct safe harbour eligibility analysis early to right-size resource requirements.

### Use Transitional Simplified Reporting

OECD guidance permits simplified jurisdictional reporting (rather than constituent entity basis) for fiscal years beginning on or before December 31, 2028. This can reduce data collection burden significantly for Year 1-4.

### Automate Where Possible

| Process | Manual Effort | Automation Option |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Data extraction | High | ERP reports, APIs |
| Currency conversion | Medium | Automated FX feeds |
| Validation checks | High | Calculator built-in rules |
| XML generation | Medium | Export functionality |

### Build Reusable Infrastructure

| Investment | Year 1 Cost | Year 2+ Benefit |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Entity master database | Higher setup | Lower maintenance |
| Standard data templates | Development time | Faster collection |
| Automated extractions | IT investment | Reduced manual effort |
| Documented processes | Time to document | Faster onboarding |

## Summary

Successful GIR implementation requires careful resource planning across people, process, and technology dimensions:

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Cross-functional team essential:** Tax cannot deliver alone—Finance, IT, HR, and Legal must be engaged
2. **Scale resources to complexity:** Entity count and jurisdictions drive resource requirements
3. **50% use co-sourcing:** Most organizations blend internal and external resources
4. **Technology investment pays off:** Manual approaches are unsustainable for ongoing compliance
5. **Budget appropriately:** Expect £250,000-500,000+ annually depending on complexity
6. **Address skills gaps:** Pillar Two requires "hybrid" tax-technology professionals

**Critical Success Factor:** Early resource planning and executive sponsorship are essential. Organizations that treat GIR compliance as a "tax department project" without adequate cross-functional support consistently underestimate resource requirements and face deadline pressure.

**Next Steps:** Proceed to Section 14.3 (Stakeholder Communication) for guidance on briefing executives and mobilizing support across the organization.

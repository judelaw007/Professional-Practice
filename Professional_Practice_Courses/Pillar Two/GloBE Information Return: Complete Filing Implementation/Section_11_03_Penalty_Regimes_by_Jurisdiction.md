# Section 11.3: Penalty Regimes by Jurisdiction

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Identify late filing penalties across key implementing jurisdictions
- Understand incomplete and incorrect filing penalty exposure
- Recognise failure to register and elect DFE penalties
- Apply the OECD Transitional Penalty Relief regime
- Use the Penalty Summary Matrix for multi-jurisdiction compliance planning

---

## Introduction

Pillar Two implementation creates new penalty exposure for MNE Groups across multiple jurisdictions. While the OECD has established a common framework for transitional penalty relief, the specific penalty amounts and mechanisms vary significantly by jurisdiction.

This section provides a comprehensive overview of penalty regimes across 15 key implementing jurisdictions, enabling practitioners to:
- Quantify penalty risk for compliance planning
- Prioritise filing efforts based on penalty severity
- Document "reasonable measures" for penalty mitigation
- Coordinate penalty defence across multiple authorities

---

## Part 1: OECD Transitional Penalty Relief Framework

### 1.1 Common Understanding on Penalty Relief

The OECD Inclusive Framework agreed on a transitional penalty relief regime recognising the complexity of first-time GloBE compliance.

**Core Principle:**
> "No penalties or sanctions should apply during a transitional period in connection with filing GloBE Information Returns where an MNE has taken reasonable measures to ensure the correct application of the GloBE rules."

**Transitional Period:**
- **Start:** Fiscal years beginning on or before 31 December 2026
- **End:** Fiscal years ending on or before 30 June 2028

**"Reasonable Measures" Standard:**

| Factor | Evidence Required |
|--------|-------------------|
| Good faith effort | Documented intent to comply |
| Professional advice | Engagement letters, advisor correspondence |
| Systems implementation | GloBE calculation systems, controls |
| Training | Staff training records |
| Timely disclosure | Voluntary error disclosure |
| Prompt correction | Amendment filed without delay |

### 1.2 Jurisdictional Implementation of Relief

| Jurisdiction | Transitional Relief Adopted | Specific Provisions |
|--------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| United Kingdom | Yes | Reasonable excuse defence |
| Germany | Yes | Penalty waived if reasonable measures proven |
| Netherlands | Yes | Soft-landing approach |
| France | Yes | Good faith compliance |
| Ireland | Yes | No penalties if reasonable care taken |
| Australia | Yes | ATO "soft-landing" PCG 2025/4 (formerly Draft PCG 2025/D3) |
| Luxembourg | Yes | Per OECD framework |
| Switzerland | Yes | CIT analogy provisions |
| Japan | Yes | Per OECD framework |
| Singapore | Expected | Anticipated alignment |

**Escalating Penalties:**
If a group fails to file for three successive accounting periods and was liable to penalty in each of the first two periods, escalating penalties apply.

| **Medium** | Moderate fixed penalties | Germany, Netherlands, Belgium |
| **Lower** | Existing tax penalty frameworks | Switzerland, Japan, Sweden |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Transitional relief is conditional**: The OECD framework provides relief only where "reasonable measures" can be demonstrated - it is not automatic

2. **Penalty structures vary significantly**: From €469 (Netherlands initial) to €300,000 (Luxembourg) to €1M cap (France)

3. **Criminal exposure exists**: France specifically provides for imprisonment (up to 5 years) and substantial criminal fines

4. **Interest always applies**: Even where penalties are waived, interest on late payment generally still accrues

5. **DFE election failures multiply exposure**: Without proper DFE election, each CE may face separate filing obligations and penalties

6. **Documentation is critical**: Demonstrating "reasonable measures" requires contemporaneous documentation of compliance efforts

7. **Multi-jurisdiction coordination essential**: Different penalty regimes require prioritised filing strategies based on risk exposure

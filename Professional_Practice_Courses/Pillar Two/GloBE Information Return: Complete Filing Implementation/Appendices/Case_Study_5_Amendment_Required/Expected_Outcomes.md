# Case Study 5: Phoenix Aerospace Holdings - Expected Outcomes

## Materiality Assessment - Expected Conclusion

| Test | Result | Conclusion |
|------|--------|------------|
| Absolute change >€100,000 | €539,544 | **MATERIAL** |
| Percentage change >10% | 61% increase | **MATERIAL** |

## Amended GIR Calculations

### GIR ETR Calculator (GIR-001) - Ireland

| Output | Original | Corrected |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| GloBE Income | €28,400,000 | €42,600,000 |
| Adjusted Covered Taxes | €3,180,480 | €4,771,200 |
| **ETR** | **11.20%** | **11.20%** |
| **Top-up Tax %** | **3.80%** | **3.80%** |

**Key Point:** ETR unchanged because both income and taxes increased proportionally. However, the absolute Top-up Tax increases because Excess Profit is higher.

### GIR Top-Up Tax Calculator (GIR-003) - Ireland

| Output | Original | Corrected | Change |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|
| GloBE Income | €28,400,000 | €42,600,000 | +€14,200,000 |
| SBIE | €5,112,000 | €5,112,000 | — |
| Excess Profit | €23,288,000 | €37,488,000 | +€14,200,000 |
| Top-up Tax % | 3.80% | 3.80% | — |
| **Top-up Tax** | **€885,000** | **€1,424,544** | **+€539,544** |

**Calculation:**
```
Original: €23,288,000 × 3.80% = €885,144 (rounded to €885,000)
Corrected: €37,488,000 × 3.80% = €1,424,544
Increase: €539,544
```

## Penalty Assessment - Expected Outcome

### Transitional Relief Application

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Within transitional period | YES (FY2024) |
| Reasonable measures demonstrated | YES |
| Voluntary disclosure | YES (self-reported) |
| Timely correction | YES (<6 weeks) |

### Expected Penalty

| Position | Penalty |
|----------|---------|
| **Primary position** | 0% (transitional relief + reasonable care) |
| Fallback position | 0-15% (unprompted careless error) |

**Rationale:** FY2024 is within the OECD transitional penalty relief period. Phoenix Aerospace can demonstrate:
- Big 4 advisor engagement
- Documented preparation procedures
- Staff training on Pillar Two
- Three-stage review process
- Voluntary, prompt disclosure

## Interest Calculation

| Calculation | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Underpaid amount | £463,050 |
| Days late | 112 |
| Interest rate | 7.5% p.a. |
| **Interest due** | **£10,661** |

**Formula:**
```
Interest = £463,050 × 7.5% × (112/365) = £10,661
```

## Total Amendment Payment

| Component | Amount (GBP) |
|-----------|--------------|
| Additional Top-up Tax | £463,050 |
| Interest | £10,661 |
| **Total Payment** | **£473,711** |

## Learning Points

1. **ETR Unchanged ≠ No Impact**: Even when ETR stays the same, increased GloBE Income means higher Excess Profit and higher Top-up Tax.

2. **Materiality Testing**: Apply both quantitative (€100,000 / 10%) and qualitative (systematic error risk, repeat filing impact) tests.

3. **Transitional Relief**: FY2024-FY2028 filings benefit from penalty relief where "reasonable measures" are demonstrated.

4. **Interest Not Avoidable**: Even with penalty relief, interest accrues on underpayments. Prompt amendment minimises interest.

5. **Documentation is Critical**: Comprehensive records of processes, controls, and error response are essential for penalty mitigation.

6. **Process Improvement**: Each error should result in documented improvements to prevent recurrence (e.g., intercompany reconciliation checklist).

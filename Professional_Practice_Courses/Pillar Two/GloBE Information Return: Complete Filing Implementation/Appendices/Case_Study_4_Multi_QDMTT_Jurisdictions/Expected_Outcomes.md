## Netherlands - Expected Results

### GIR ETR Calculator (GIR-001)

| Output | Expected Value |
|--------|----------------|
| ETR | 12.36% |
| Top-up Tax % | 2.64% |
| Status | Low-Taxed Jurisdiction |

**Calculation:**
```
ETR = €3,090,000 / €25,000,000 = 12.36%
Top-up Tax % = 15% - 12.36% = 2.64%
```

## Policy Outcome Analysis

### Without QDMTT (Hypothetical)

| Collector | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| UK (IIR) | €1,612,603 |
| Netherlands | €0 |
| Switzerland | €0 |
| Ireland | €0 |

### With QDMTT (Actual)

| Collector | Amount |
|-----------|--------|
| UK (IIR) | €0 |
| Netherlands | €644,503 |
| Switzerland | €668,680 |
| Ireland | €299,420 |

**Key Point:** Total tax collected is the same (€1,612,603). QDMTT determines WHERE it's collected, not HOW MUCH.

## Learning Points

1. **Rule Ordering**: QDMTT applies first, then IIR. QDMTT is a pound-for-pound offset.

2. **Policy Intent**: QDMTT preserves source country taxing rights. Low-tax jurisdictions can collect their own Top-up Tax rather than having it flow to the UPE jurisdiction.

3. **Net IIR Often Zero**: For MNEs operating primarily in QDMTT jurisdictions, the UK IIR charge is often zero because local QDMTTs collect the full Top-up Tax.

4. **Jurisdictional Blending**: Within each jurisdiction, entities are blended for ETR purposes. Ireland's legacy 12.5% entity is blended with 15%+ entities, resulting in 13.9% blended ETR.

5. **Regime Variations**: Each QDMTT jurisdiction has different filing requirements, deadlines, and procedures. Coordination is essential.

## Learning Points

1. **POPE Allocation**: When a POPE exists, Top-up Tax is split - UPE gets its indirect share, POPE collects for external investors

2. **JV Separation**: Never blend JV results with main group, even if in the same jurisdiction

3. **MOCE Treatment**: UPE only bears its ownership percentage of MOCE/MOS Top-up Tax

4. **Multi-tiered Ownership**: Calculate indirect ownership by multiplying through the chain (e.g., 70% × 100% = 70% indirect)

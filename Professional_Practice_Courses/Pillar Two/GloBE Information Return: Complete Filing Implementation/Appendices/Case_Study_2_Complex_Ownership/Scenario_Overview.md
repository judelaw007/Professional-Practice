# Case Study 2: Meridian Industrial Group - Complex Ownership Structure

## Scenario Context

This case study presents **Meridian Industrial Group plc**, a UK-headquartered multinational with complex ownership structures including:
- Partially-Owned Parent Entities (POPEs)
- Joint Ventures (JVs)
- Minority-Owned Constituent Entities (MOCEs)

You will practice calculating Top-up Tax allocation across complex ownership chains.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this case study, you will be able to:
- Identify and classify POPEs, JVs, and MOCEs
- Calculate ownership percentages through multi-tiered structures
- Allocate Top-up Tax between UPE and external investors
- Understand how JVs are treated as separate MNE groups

## Company Profile

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Ultimate Parent Entity** | Meridian Industrial Group plc (UK) |
| **Fiscal Year End** | 31 December 2024 |
| **Consolidated Revenue** | €2.8 billion |
| **Total Constituent Entities** | 120 |
| **Joint Ventures** | 3 |
| **Minority-Owned Subgroups** | 1 |
| **Partially-Owned Parent Entities** | 2 |

## Complex Structures

### 1. POPE Structure
- **Meridian Tech Ventures BV** (Netherlands) - 70% owned by UPE, 30% external
- Owns 100% of Meridian AI Ireland Ltd (low ETR)
- Owns 100% of Meridian Quantum GmbH (Germany)

### 2. Joint Venture Structure
- **MeridiaTech JV LLC** (USA) - 50% owned by UPE, 50% external partner
- Treated as separate MNE group for GloBE purposes

### 3. MOCE Structure
- **Meridian Green Energy Ltd** (Ireland) - 25% owned but controlled by UPE
- Forms Minority-Owned Subgroup with subsidiaries

## Demo Tools to Use

| Tool | Tool ID | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| GIR ETR Calculator | GIR-001 | Calculate ETR for POPE subsidiaries |
| GIR Top-Up Tax Calculator | GIR-003 | Calculate allocation between POPE and UPE |

## Key Learning Points

1. **POPE allocation**: Top-up Tax is split proportionally between UPE and external investors
2. **JV separation**: JV groups have their own GloBE calculations (no blending with main group)
3. **MOCE treatment**: Separate ETR calculation; UPE only bears its ownership share

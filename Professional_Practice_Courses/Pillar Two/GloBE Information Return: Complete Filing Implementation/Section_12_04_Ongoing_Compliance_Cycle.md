# Section 12.4: Ongoing Compliance Cycle

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Implement an annual GIR refresh process aligned with financial reporting cycles
- Apply year-over-year comparison tools to identify trends and anomalies
- Establish a continuous improvement framework for Pillar Two compliance
- Integrate GIR compliance into the broader tax operating model
- Prepare for evolving OECD guidance and legislative changes

---

## Introduction

Pillar Two compliance is not a one-time project—it is an ongoing operational requirement. With first filings due 30 June 2026 (for December 2024 year-ends), MNE Groups must establish sustainable processes that:

- Repeat reliably each fiscal year
- Adapt to changing rules and guidance
- Improve efficiency over time
- Maintain quality and consistency
- Scale with business changes

This section establishes the framework for ongoing Pillar Two compliance excellence.

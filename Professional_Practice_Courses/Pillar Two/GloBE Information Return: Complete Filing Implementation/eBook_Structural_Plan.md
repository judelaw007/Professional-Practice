## Development Notes for Course Creators

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Implementation Focus**
   - Every section must answer "How do I do this?" not "What is this?"
   - Skip all Pillar Two history, policy rationale, and conceptual explanations
   - Assume learners already understand GloBE Rules basics

2. **Template Quality**
   - All Excel tools must have working formulas, validation, and instructions
   - All Word templates must be 80%+ complete - just fill in specifics
   - All checklists must have actionable, specific checkpoints

3. **Screenshot Requirements**
   - Include actual portal screenshots for all 15 main jurisdictions
   - Show real XML validation tool interfaces
   - Display Calculator screens with sample data

4. **Currency and Accuracy**
   - Verify all portal links within 30 days of launch
   - Update deadline calendar annually
   - Monitor for OECD Administrative Guidance updates

5. **Practical Problem-Solving**
   - Address real data gaps practitioners face
   - Provide workarounds for ERP limitations
   - Include troubleshooting for common XML errors

### Quality Assurance Checklist

Before launch, verify:
- [ ] All 200+ data points in tracker are accurate per OECD schema
- [ ] Calculator formulas tested with multiple scenarios
- [ ] XML generation produces valid output
- [ ] All 25+ portal links tested and working
- [ ] All deadlines verified against official sources

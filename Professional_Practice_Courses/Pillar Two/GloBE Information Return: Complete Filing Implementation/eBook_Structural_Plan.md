## Development Notes for Course Creators

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Implementation Focus**
   - Every section must answer "How do I do this?" not "What is this?"
   - Skip all Pillar Two history, policy rationale, and conceptual explanations
   - Assume learners already understand GloBE Rules basics

2. **Demo Tools Integration**
   - All 9 demo tools registered in TOOLS-REGISTRY (2).csv
   - Each tool introduced in the relevant chapter with "Practice This Skill" section
   - Clear distinction between demo tools (learning) and professional tools (production)
   - Case study data aligned with tool practice exercises

3. **Case Study Quality**
   - Each case study has complete sample data for practice
   - Expected outcomes documented for self-assessment
   - Progressive complexity across 5 case studies
   - Tools mapped to case studies in Scenario_Overview.md

4. **Screenshot Requirements**
   - Include actual portal screenshots for all 15 main jurisdictions
   - Show real XML validation tool interfaces
   - Display demo tool interfaces with sample data

5. **Currency and Accuracy**
   - Verify all portal links within 30 days of launch
   - Update deadline calendar annually
   - Monitor for OECD Administrative Guidance updates

6. **Practical Problem-Solving**
   - Address real data gaps practitioners face
   - Provide workarounds for ERP limitations
   - Include troubleshooting for common XML errors

### Quality Assurance Checklist

**Content Quality:**
- [ ] All ~480 data points documented per OECD January 2025 schema
- [ ] All 9 demo tools specified in TOOLS-REGISTRY (2).csv
- [ ] "Practice This Skill" sections added to all relevant chapters
- [ ] Demo vs professional tool distinction included
- [ ] All 25+ portal links tested and working
- [ ] All deadlines verified against official sources

**Case Studies:**
- [ ] All 5 case studies have complete sample data
- [ ] Expected outcomes documented for each case study
- [ ] Tool-to-case study mapping verified
- [ ] Case studies referenced in "Practice This Skill" sections

**Appendix Structure:**
- [ ] Appendices contain case studies only (no template libraries)
- [ ] Archive folder contains original templates (preserved, not deleted)
- [ ] External_Tools_Library populated with third-party resources
- [ ] README.md in Appendices explains new structure

**END OF STRUCTURAL PLAN**

---

*This document provides the complete structural framework for developing the GloBE Information Return: Complete Filing Implementation Professional Practice Course. Course developers should use this plan to ensure comprehensive coverage, logical flow, and no conflicts between topics. All sections should be developed with an implementation-first approach, providing practitioners with ready-to-use tools and step-by-step guidance for their first GIR filing.*

# Section 1: Why This Matters Now and What You'll Get

**Estimated Reading Time:** 45 minutes
**Pages:** 20-25

---

## Learning Objectives for This Section

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

- Identify the critical filing deadline for your MNE Group's first GloBE Information Return
- Determine whether your group is in scope for GIR filing requirements
- Understand the penalty framework and transitional relief provisions
- Access the complete inventory of tools and templates included in this course
- Plan your 6-month implementation timeline with specific milestones

---

## 1.1 The Compliance Imperative

### Your First Filing Deadline: June 30, 2026

If your MNE Group has a fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, your first GloBE Information Return (GIR) must be filed by **June 30, 2026**.

This is not optional. This is not "best practice." This is a legal compliance requirement in 65+ jurisdictions worldwide.

| Fiscal Year End | First GIR Due Date | Extended Deadline |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| December 31, 2024 | June 30, 2026 | 18 months (first year) |
| March 31, 2025 | September 30, 2026 | 18 months (first year) |
| June 30, 2025 | December 31, 2026 | 18 months (first year) |
| December 31, 2025 | March 31, 2027 | 15 months (subsequent years) |

**Key timing rule:** For your first in-scope fiscal year, you have 18 months from fiscal year end to file. For all subsequent years, the deadline reduces to 15 months.

**Important:** The OECD Administrative Guidance (December 2023) explicitly states that the due date for filing and notification obligations shall not be before June 30, 2026, regardless of fiscal year end. This means even short accounting periods that would mathematically have an earlier deadline are extended to June 30, 2026.

---

### Who Is In Scope?

The GloBE Rules apply to **Constituent Entities** in MNE Groups that meet **both** of the following criteria:

**Criterion 1: Multinational Group Structure**
- Your group must have entities in at least two different jurisdictions
- This includes subsidiaries, branches, permanent establishments, and certain joint ventures

**Criterion 2: Revenue Threshold**
- Annual consolidated revenue of **€750 million or more**
- In at least **two of the four fiscal years** preceding the relevant fiscal year

| Revenue Test | Fiscal Years Tested | Threshold |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| FY 2024 GIR | FY 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 | €750M in at least 2 years |
| FY 2025 GIR | FY 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 | €750M in at least 2 years |
| FY 2026 GIR | FY 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 | €750M in at least 2 years |

**Impact:** The OECD estimates that approximately 90% of global corporate revenues are controlled by MNE Groups exceeding this threshold. If you are reading this course, your group is almost certainly in scope.

---

### What Happens If You Don't File?

Penalties for GIR non-compliance vary by jurisdiction but are substantial:

**Penalty Categories:**

| Penalty Type | Description | Risk Level |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **Late Filing** | Fixed penalties plus daily/monthly accruals | HIGH |
| **Incomplete Filing** | Penalties for missing data fields or incomplete sections | MEDIUM-HIGH |
| **Incorrect Information** | Additional tax plus penalties for material misstatements | HIGH |
| **Failure to Register** | Penalties for not registering as filing entity by deadline | MEDIUM |
| **Record-Keeping Failures** | Penalties for inadequate documentation | MEDIUM |

**Example: UK HMRC Approach**
- Groups must register within **6 months** of first accounting period end
- For December 31, 2024 year-end groups: registration deadline is **June 30, 2025**
- Late registration and late filing penalties apply
- Standard UK corporate tax record retention requirements apply

**Example: Australia ATO Approach**
- The ATO has released Practical Compliance Guideline PCG 2025/4 (formerly Draft PCG 2025/D3) outlining a "soft-landing" approach
- Transitional penalty relief available but **not automatic**
- MNE Groups must demonstrate "reasonable measures" to comply
- The onus is on the taxpayer to prove good faith compliance efforts

---

### Transitional Penalty Relief: Don't Rely On It

The OECD Inclusive Framework has published guidance on transitional penalty relief (Annex C of the January 2025 Administrative Guidance). Here's what you need to know:

**Relief Period:**
- Applies to fiscal years beginning on or before **December 31, 2026**
- Does not apply to fiscal years ending after **June 30, 2028**
- In practice: relief available for approximately 3 years for most groups

**Relief Is NOT Automatic:**

Tax authorities will give "careful consideration" before applying penalties where a business has taken **reasonable measures** to apply the Pillar Two rules.

**What Constitutes "Reasonable Measures"?**

| Reasonable Measure | Evidence Required |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Engaged with compliance requirements early | Documentation of project initiation, budget allocation |
| Implemented data collection processes | Evidence of GIR data tracker completion, ERP extraction |
| Made good faith calculations | Working papers showing calculation methodology |
| Filed timely (even if imperfect) | Submission confirmation before deadline |
| Corrected errors promptly | Amended returns filed when errors discovered |

**What Does NOT Qualify:**
- "We didn't know" - not an excuse with 65+ countries now implementing
- "Our systems aren't ready" - you've had since 2021 to prepare
- "It's too complex" - complexity is not grounds for non-compliance
- Waiting until penalty relief expires to start compliance efforts

**Bottom Line:** Transitional relief is a safety net for good-faith efforts, not a free pass for non-compliance.

---

### Current Implementation Status

As of late 2025, the Pillar Two implementation landscape is mature and accelerating:

**Global Implementation:**

| Region | Countries with IIR | Countries with UTPR | Countries with QDMTT |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **EU (27 states)** | 22 (2024-2025) | 22 (2025) | 22 (2024-2025) |
| **Non-EU Europe** | UK, Norway, Switzerland | UK, Norway, Turkey | UK, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey |
| **Asia-Pacific** | Australia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong | Australia, South Korea | Australia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong |
| **Americas** | Canada (expected), Curaçao | Canada (expected) | Brazil, Bermuda, Curaçao |
| **Other** | South Africa, Guernsey, Gibraltar | - | South Africa, Guernsey, Gibraltar |

**Total:** As of August 2025, **65 countries** have either introduced draft legislation or adopted final legislation transposing Pillar Two's model rules into national laws.

**Key Dates by Jurisdiction:**

| Jurisdiction | IIR Effective | UTPR Effective | QDMTT Effective |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| United Kingdom | Jan 1, 2024 | Dec 31, 2024 | Jan 1, 2024 |
| Germany | Jan 1, 2024 | Jan 1, 2025 | Jan 1, 2024 |
| France | Jan 1, 2024 | Jan 1, 2025 | Jan 1, 2024 |
| Netherlands | Jan 1, 2024 | Jan 1, 2025 | Jan 1, 2024 |
| Australia | Jan 1, 2024 | Jan 1, 2025 | Jan 1, 2024 |
| Japan | Apr 1, 2024 | Apr 1, 2026 | Apr 1, 2026 |
| Singapore | Jan 1, 2025 | TBD | Jan 1, 2025 |
| South Korea | Jan 1, 2024 | Jan 1, 2025 | - |
| Hong Kong | Jan 1, 2025 | TBD | Jan 1, 2025 |
| Switzerland | Jan 1, 2025 | Not planned | Jan 1, 2024 |

### What This Course Does NOT Cover

This is a **Professional Practice Course**. We assume you already understand:

- What Pillar Two is and why it was created
- The basic mechanics of the IIR, UTPR, and QDMTT
- The policy rationale behind the 15% global minimum tax
- The history of BEPS and international tax reform

**If you need this background:** Complete a foundational Pillar Two course before starting this implementation-focused program.

**What we DO cover:** How to file a GIR correctly, on time, with the right data, using practical tools and templates.

---

## 1.2 Who Must File and When

### Filing Entity Determination

Not every entity in your MNE Group files a GIR. The filing obligation works as follows:

**Default Rule:** Each Constituent Entity must file a GIR with its local tax authority.

**Exception (Most Common):** If the group designates a **Designated Filing Entity (DFE)**, the DFE files centrally, and other entities rely on exchange of information agreements.

**Practical Reality:** Most groups will designate a single DFE (usually the Ultimate Parent Entity (UPE) location) to file one consolidated GIR.

---

### The Designated Filing Entity Election

| Aspect | Requirement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Who can be DFE** | Any Constituent Entity in the group |
| **Typical choice** | UPE location (headquarters country) |
| **Election timing** | Made with first GIR filing |
| **Change permitted** | Yes, with proper notification |
| **Multi-DFE allowed** | Yes, but adds complexity |

**UK-Specific Requirement:**
If your group files a GIR with a tax authority outside the UK, and expects that tax authority to share it with HMRC under an exchange agreement, you must still file an **Overseas Return Notification (ORN)** in the UK, advising HMRC where the GIR was filed.

---

### Filing Timeline: Complete Calendar

**For December 31, 2024 Fiscal Year End:**

| Date | Milestone | Action Required |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Dec 31, 2024** | FY end | Fiscal year closes |
| **Jun 30, 2025** | Registration deadline (UK) | Register with HMRC |
| **Q3-Q4 2025** | Data gathering | Extract GIR data from ERPs |
| **Q1 2026** | GIR preparation | Complete calculator, validate data |
| **Q2 2026** | XML generation | Generate and validate XML file |
| **Jun 30, 2026** | Filing deadline | Submit GIR (or ORN) and SA return |

**For Other Fiscal Year Ends:**

| FY End | Registration (UK) | First GIR Due |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| Mar 31, 2025 | Sep 30, 2025 | Sep 30, 2026 |
| Jun 30, 2025 | Dec 31, 2025 | Dec 31, 2026 |
| Sep 30, 2025 | Mar 31, 2026 | Mar 31, 2027 |
| Dec 31, 2025 | Jun 30, 2026 | Mar 31, 2027* |

*Note: Second-year filings use 15-month deadline, not 18-month.

---

### Special Rules and Extensions

**No Filing Before June 30, 2026:**
The OECD Administrative Guidance provides that the due date for filing and notification obligations shall not be before June 30, 2026. This protects groups with short accounting periods or early fiscal year ends from having impossibly early deadlines.

**Short Accounting Periods:**
Example: A 6-month accounting period ending June 30, 2024 would mathematically have a filing deadline of December 31, 2025 (18 months). However, this is automatically extended to June 30, 2026 under the OECD rule.

**Extension Procedures:**
Extension availability varies by jurisdiction. Check local rules for:
- UK: Extensions may be available in limited circumstances
- Germany: Specific extension request procedures
- Australia: ATO has indicated flexibility during transitional period

---

### Multiple Filing Obligations

In addition to the GIR, you may have:

**UK Requirements:**
1. **Registration** - Within 6 months of first in-scope period end
2. **GIR or ORN** - GIR if filing in UK; ORN if filing elsewhere
3. **Self Assessment Return** - UK SA return with MTT/DTT liability
4. **Payment** - MTT/DTT due same deadline as returns

**All three (or four) obligations have the same deadline** - typically June 30, 2026 for December 2024 year-ends.

---

### Transitional Safe Harbours: Simplified Filing Requirements

If your group qualifies for a **Transitional Safe Harbour**, your GIR filing requirements may be reduced.

**Transitional CbCR Safe Harbour:**

| Test | Criteria | ETR Threshold |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **De Minimis Test** | Revenue < €10M AND Profit < €1M | N/A |
| **ETR Test (FY 2024)** | Simplified ETR ≥ 15% | 15% |
| **ETR Test (FY 2025)** | Simplified ETR ≥ 16% | 16% |
| **ETR Test (FY 2026)** | Simplified ETR ≥ 17% | 17% |
| **Routine Profits Test** | Profit ≤ SBIE amount | N/A |

**Important:** Qualifying for a safe harbour does **not** exempt you from filing a GIR. It reduces the information required but the filing obligation remains.

**Safe Harbour Duration:**
- Applies to fiscal years beginning on or before December 31, 2026
- Does not apply to fiscal years ending after June 30, 2028
- "Once out, always out" rule: if you fail to qualify in one year, you cannot use the safe harbour in subsequent years

## 1.3 How This Course Helps You Learn

This course uses a **practical, hands-on learning approach** designed to build real-world GIR compliance skills. Rather than providing files to download, we focus on:

1. **Inline Examples** - Templates, forms, and calculation structures shown directly in the content where they're explained
2. **Demo Tools** - Practice calculators on tools.mojitax.com for hands-on skill building
3. **Case Studies** - Progressive scenarios with sample data in the Appendices for practice and verification

---

### Learning Through Demo Tools

When you need to practice GIR calculations, this course integrates with **demo tools on tools.mojitax.com**. These are simplified, educational versions of the calculators you'll encounter in professional practice.

| Demo Tool | Purpose | Practice With |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| **GIR ETR Calculator** | Calculate jurisdictional Effective Tax Rate | Case Study 1: GlobalTech |
| **GIR SBIE Calculator** | Calculate Substance-Based Income Exclusion | Case Study 1-4 |
| **GIR Top-Up Tax Calculator** | Calculate complete Top-up Tax | All case studies |
| **Safe Harbour Qualification Tool** | Assess CbCR Safe Harbour eligibility | Case Study 1 |

**Important:** These are demo tools for learning—not replacements for professional Pillar Two software. In professional practice, you would use enterprise software with full audit trails, multi-user access, and compliance features. The demo tools help you understand the mechanics without production complexity.

---

### Learning Through Case Studies

The Appendices contain **5 progressive case studies** based on realistic MNE scenarios. Each case study includes:

- **Scenario Overview** - Context and learning objectives
- **Sample Data** - Input values for the demo tools
- **Expected Outcomes** - Results to verify your calculations

| Case Study | Scenario | Key Learning |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| **1. GlobalTech First Filing** | Standard MNE with Ireland/Switzerland below 15% | ETR, SBIE, Top-up Tax basics |
| **2. Complex Ownership** | POPE, JV, MOCE structures | Top-up Tax allocation |
| **3. Data Gap Challenges** | Mid-year acquisition, legacy systems | Estimation methodologies |
| **4. Multi-QDMTT Jurisdictions** | NL, CH, IE QDMTT coordination | QDMTT offset mechanism |
| **5. Amendment Required** | Post-filing error correction | Amendment procedures, penalty mitigation |

---

### Learning Through Inline Examples

When a template, form structure, or calculation methodology is important for your understanding, we show it **directly in the eBook content**—not as a separate file to download. This means:

- You see the complete structure with annotations explaining each element
- You understand the "why" behind each field
- You can immediately apply what you learn using demo tools

For example, when we explain the DFE Election documentation in Section 3, you'll see the complete structure inline with guidance on completing each section.

---

### What If You're Behind Schedule?

If you're reading this course after January 2026 and have a June 30, 2026 deadline:

**Compressed 3-Month Timeline:**

| Month | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Apr 2026 | Scoping, data inventory, extraction (compressed) |
| May 2026 | Calculator population, validation, XML generation |
| Jun 2026 | Testing, filing, documentation |

**Critical Actions:**
1. **Engage external advisors immediately** - You need additional resources
2. **Focus on must-have data first** - Prioritize Section 3 (GloBE Computations)
3. **Use transitional safe harbours if eligible** - Reduces data requirements
4. **Document your good-faith efforts** - Essential for penalty relief

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't skip the filing deadline - file even if imperfect
- Don't guess at data - document estimations with methodology
- Don't ignore registration deadlines - UK registration may already be overdue

---

## Section 1 Summary: Key Takeaways

| Topic | Key Point |
|-------|-----------|
| **Deadline** | June 30, 2026 for December 31, 2024 fiscal year ends |
| **Scope** | €750M+ consolidated revenue in 2 of 4 preceding years |
| **Penalties** | Substantial, but transitional relief available for good-faith efforts |
| **Implementation** | 65+ countries now have Pillar Two rules |
| **Learning Approach** | Inline examples + demo tools on tools.mojitax.com + case studies |

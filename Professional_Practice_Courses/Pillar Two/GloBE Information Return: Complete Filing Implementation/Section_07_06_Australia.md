# Section 7.6: Australia

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Navigate the ATO Online Services for Pillar Two filings
- Understand Australia's four filing obligations (GIR, FNF, AIUTR, DMTR)
- Submit the Combined Global and Domestic Minimum Tax Return (CGDMTR)
- Apply transitional relief provisions under PCG 2025/4 (formerly Draft PCG 2025/D3)
- Understand the penalty framework and maximum exposures
- Apply the Australia Pillar Two Filing Checklist for compliance assurance

## Introduction

Australia implemented Pillar Two through the Taxation (Multinational—Global and Domestic Minimum Tax) Act 2024 and supporting legislation, effective for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2024. The framework introduces:

- **Domestic Minimum Tax (DMT)** - Australia's QDMTT, effective 1 January 2024
- **Income Inclusion Rule (IIR)** - Effective 1 January 2024
- **Undertaxed Profits Rule (UTPR)** - Effective 1 January 2025

**Critical Point:** Australia's Pillar Two rules have retrospective effect from 1 January 2024. The first filings are due **30 June 2026** for December year-end groups. Maximum penalties can reach **A$825,000** per entity, though transitional relief applies.

```

---

## 7.6.6 Domestic Minimum Tax (DMT)

### Australian DMT Framework

```
Australian DMT (QDMTT):
│
├── PURPOSE
│   ├── Ensures 15% minimum ETR on Australian profits
│   ├── Collected before foreign IIR/UTPR can apply
│   ├── Australia retains top-up tax revenue
│   └── Recognised as QDMTT by OECD (January 2025)
│
├── WHEN APPLICABLE
│   ├── Australian jurisdictional ETR < 15%
│   ├── Calculated per GloBE rules
│   ├── May apply with significant tax incentives
│   └── R&D tax offset, losses, timing differences
│
├── CALCULATION
│   ├── Australian GloBE income determined
│   ├── Australian covered taxes identified
│   ├── Substance-based income exclusions applied
│   ├── ETR calculated
│   └── Top-up to 15% if required
│
└── QDMTT SAFE HARBOUR
    ├── Australia's DMT qualifies as QDMTT
    ├── Foreign jurisdictions cannot collect IIR/UTPR
    │   on Australian income where DMT applies
    └── Reduces compliance burden for Australian entities
```

### Australian Tax Rate Context

```
Australian Corporate Tax Rates:
│
├── STANDARD RATES
│   ├── Large companies: 30%
│   ├── Base rate entities: 25%
│   └── Generally well above 15% minimum
│
├── SITUATIONS THAT MAY REDUCE ETR
│   ├── R&D tax incentive (refundable offset)
│   ├── Carried forward losses
│   ├── Franking credits/dividend offsets
│   ├── Foreign income tax offsets
│   └── Timing differences on provisions
│
└── DMT IMPACT
    ├── DMT applies where ETR falls below 15%
    ├── Relatively uncommon given high standard rate
    └── Most likely with significant R&D incentives
```

---

## 7.6.7 Penalties and Transitional Relief

### Penalty Framework

```
Australian Pillar Two Penalties:
│
├── FAILURE TO LODGE (FTL) PENALTY
│   ├── Penalty unit: A$330 (current)
│   ├── Rate: 500 penalty units per 28-day period (or part)
│   ├── Maximum: 2,500 penalty units
│   ├── Maximum amount: A$825,000 per entity
│   └── Each entity liable separately for each obligation
│
├── PENALTY CALCULATION EXAMPLE
│   │
│   │ Entity fails to lodge for 3 months (84 days):
│   │ ├── 28-day periods: 3 (84 ÷ 28)
│   │ ├── Penalty: 3 × 500 × $330 = $495,000
│   │ └── Per entity, per obligation
│
├── MULTIPLE ENTITIES
│   ├── Each Australian CE may be separately liable
│   ├── Total group exposure = entities × obligations × penalty
│   └── Potentially significant for large groups
│
└── OTHER PENALTIES
    ├── Incorrect information penalties
    ├── Late payment penalties
    └── General administration penalties
```

### Transitional Relief (PCG 2025/4)

│
├── TRANSITION PERIOD
│   ├── Fiscal years commencing on or before 31 December 2026
│   ├── Ending on or before 30 June 2028
│   └── "Soft landing" approach applies
│
├── ATO APPROACH DURING TRANSITION
│   ├── Generally remit penalties to ONE per MNE group

## Summary

Australia's implementation through the Taxation (Multinational—Global and Domestic Minimum Tax) Act 2024 creates comprehensive obligations:

1. **GIR** - OECD standardised return (separate filing)
2. **CGDMTR** - Combined Australian return (FNF + AIUTR + DMTR)
3. **First deadline** - 30 June 2026 for December year-end groups
4. **Maximum penalty** - A$825,000 per entity per obligation
5. **Transitional relief** - Soft landing through PCG 2025/4

Key considerations:
- Retrospective application from 1 January 2024
- Australia's DMT recognised as QDMTT
- Forms still being developed (check ATO for updates)
- Document "reasonable measures" for transitional relief
- High standard tax rate (25-30%) means DMT rarely applies

---

## Section Review Questions

1. What are the four filing obligations under Australian Pillar Two?

2. What is the first filing deadline for a group with 31 December year-end?

3. What is the maximum Failure to Lodge penalty per entity?

4. What authentication is required for ATO Online services?

5. What period does the transitional penalty relief cover?

6. Why is Australian DMT unlikely to apply for most groups?

**Answers:** 1) GIR, FNF, AIUTR, DMTR (consolidated into CGDMTR); 2) 30 June 2026; 3) A$825,000 (2,500 penalty units); 4) myGovID + RAM; 5) FY commencing on or before 31 Dec 2026 and ending on or before 30 June 2028; 6) Standard Australian corporate tax rate is 25-30%, well above 15%.

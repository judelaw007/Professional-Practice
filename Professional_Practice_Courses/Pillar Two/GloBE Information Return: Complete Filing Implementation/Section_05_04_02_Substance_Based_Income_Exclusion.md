# Section 5.4.2: Substance-Based Income Exclusion (SBIE)

## Introduction

The Substance-Based Income Exclusion (SBIE) is a critical component of the GloBE Top-up Tax calculation. It provides a carve-out that shields genuine economic substance—measured through payroll costs and tangible assets—from the reach of the minimum tax. Correctly calculating and documenting SBIE can significantly reduce or eliminate Top-up Tax liability for jurisdictions with substantial physical operations and workforce.

This section provides step-by-step guidance for calculating SBIE using the GIR Completion Calculator, including the transitional rate schedule, eligible cost definitions, and common pitfalls to avoid.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the SBIE formula and its role in reducing Excess Profit
- Apply transitional carve-out rates correctly for each fiscal year
- Identify eligible payroll costs and eligible tangible assets
- Calculate SBIE at entity and jurisdiction level
- Document SBIE computations for GIR Section 3

## 5.4.2.1 SBIE Fundamentals

### The Purpose of SBIE

The SBIE is designed to protect profits attributable to genuine economic substance from Top-up Tax. The concept recognizes that:

```
SBIE Rationale:
├── Profits generated by real employees performing real work
│   should not be subject to minimum tax penalties
├── Returns on physical assets (factories, equipment, infrastructure)
│   represent genuine investment returns
├── Only "excess" profits above substance-based returns
│   should potentially trigger Top-up Tax
└── Countries with significant employment and capital investment
    are rewarded with reduced Top-up Tax exposure
```

### The SBIE Formula

Under Article 5.3 of the GloBE Model Rules:

```
SBIE = Payroll Carve-out + Tangible Asset Carve-out

Where:
├── Payroll Carve-out = Eligible Payroll Costs × Payroll Rate
└── Tangible Asset Carve-out = Carrying Value of Eligible Assets × Asset Rate

Final Rates (from 2033):
├── Payroll Rate: 5.0%
└── Asset Rate: 5.0%
```

### Impact on Top-Up Tax

```
Excess Profit Calculation:
├── Net GloBE Income
├── Less: Substance-Based Income Exclusion (SBIE)
├── Equals: Jurisdictional Excess Profit
│
└── Top-up Tax = Excess Profit × Top-up Tax Percentage

Note: If SBIE ≥ GloBE Income, Excess Profit = 0, and no Top-up Tax is due
```

## 5.4.2.2 Transitional Carve-out Rates

### Complete Rate Schedule (2024-2033+)

The SBIE benefits from a 10-year transition period with elevated rates that gradually decline to the permanent 5%/5% level.

**Transitional Rate Table:**

| Fiscal Year | Payroll Rate | Tangible Asset Rate | Combined Maximum |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 2024 | 9.8% | 7.8% | 17.6% |
| 2025 | 9.6% | 7.6% | 17.2% |
| 2026 | 9.4% | 7.4% | 16.8% |
| 2027 | 9.2% | 7.2% | 16.4% |
| 2028 | 9.0% | 7.0% | 16.0% |
| 2029 | 8.2% | 6.6% | 14.8% |
| 2030 | 7.4% | 6.2% | 13.6% |
| 2031 | 6.6% | 5.8% | 12.4% |
| 2032 | 5.8% | 5.4% | 11.2% |
| 2033+ | 5.0% | 5.0% | 10.0% |

**Rate Reduction Pattern:**

```
Transition Period Structure:
├── Years 1-6 (2024-2029): Gradual reduction of 0.2% per year
│   ├── Payroll: 10.0% → 9.0% (0.2% × 5 reductions)
│   └── Tangibles: 8.0% → 7.0% (0.2% × 5 reductions)
│
└── Years 7-10 (2030-2033): Accelerated reduction
    ├── Payroll: 0.8% reduction per year
    └── Tangibles: 0.4% reduction per year
```

**Calculator Reference:**

The GIR Completion Calculator includes a rate lookup table that automatically applies the correct rates based on fiscal year input.

## 5.4.2.6 Worked Example: Multi-Jurisdiction SBIE

**Scenario: GlobalCo Holdings plc - SBIE Calculation FY 2024**

GlobalCo has operations in five jurisdictions requiring SBIE calculation (jurisdictions with ETR < 15%).

**Input Data:**

| Jurisdiction | Eligible Payroll (€M) | Eligible Assets (€M) | Net GloBE Income (€M) |
|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Ireland | 28.5 | 45.2 | 67.3 |
| Switzerland | 12.4 | 18.9 | 18.9 |
| Luxembourg | 3.2 | 5.8 | 8.5 |
| Singapore | 18.6 | 42.5 | 35.8 |
| Netherlands | 8.9 | 22.4 | 15.2 |

**SBIE Calculation (FY 2024 - Rates: Payroll 9.8%, Assets 7.8%):**

| Jurisdiction | Payroll Carve-out | Asset Carve-out | Total SBIE |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|------------|
| Ireland | €28.5M × 9.8% = €2.793M | €45.2M × 7.8% = €3.526M | **€6.319M** |
| Switzerland | €12.4M × 9.8% = €1.215M | €18.9M × 7.8% = €1.474M | **€2.689M** |
| Luxembourg | €3.2M × 9.8% = €0.314M | €5.8M × 7.8% = €0.452M | **€0.766M** |
| Singapore | €18.6M × 9.8% = €1.823M | €42.5M × 7.8% = €3.315M | **€5.138M** |
| Netherlands | €8.9M × 9.8% = €0.872M | €22.4M × 7.8% = €1.747M | **€2.619M** |

**Excess Profit Calculation:**

| Jurisdiction | GloBE Income | SBIE | Excess Profit | ETR | Top-up % |
|--------------|-------------|------|---------------|-----|----------|
| Ireland | €67.3M | €6.319M | €60.981M | 12.48% | 2.52% |
| Switzerland | €18.9M | €2.689M | €16.211M | 13.23% | 1.77% |
| Luxembourg | €8.5M | €0.766M | €7.734M | 10.59% | 4.41% |
| Singapore | €35.8M | €5.138M | €30.662M | 17.04% | 0% |
| Netherlands | €15.2M | €2.619M | €12.581M | 15.13% | 0% |

**Top-up Tax Impact:**

| Jurisdiction | Excess Profit | Top-up % | Top-up Tax |
|--------------|---------------|----------|------------|
| Ireland | €60.981M | 2.52% | **€1,537,000** |
| Switzerland | €16.211M | 1.77% | **€287,000** |
| Luxembourg | €7.734M | 4.41% | **€341,000** |
| Singapore | €30.662M | 0% | €0 (ETR ≥ 15%) |
| Netherlands | €12.581M | 0% | €0 (ETR ≥ 15%) |

**SBIE Savings Analysis:**

```
Without SBIE (Illustrative):
├── Ireland Top-up Tax would be: €67.3M × 2.52% = €1,696,000
│   └── SBIE Savings: €159,000
├── Switzerland Top-up Tax would be: €18.9M × 1.77% = €335,000
│   └── SBIE Savings: €48,000
└── Luxembourg Top-up Tax would be: €8.5M × 4.41% = €375,000
    └── SBIE Savings: €34,000

Total SBIE Savings: ~€241,000 in reduced Top-up Tax

## 5.4.2.8 Common SBIE Errors

### Error 1: Using Wrong Rate Table

**Problem:** Applying permanent rates (5%/5%) instead of transitional rates.

**Impact:** Understates SBIE, overstates Top-up Tax.

**Solution:**
```
Rate Verification:
├── FY 2024: Payroll 9.8%, Assets 7.8%
├── FY 2025: Payroll 9.6%, Assets 7.6%
├── FY 2026: Payroll 9.4%, Assets 7.4%
└── Verify fiscal year correctly mapped to rate table
```

### Error 2: Including Ineligible Assets

**Problem:** Including intangibles, inventory, or financial assets in tangible asset carve-out.

**Solution:**
```
Asset Eligibility Check:
☐ Exclude goodwill and other intangibles
☐ Exclude patents, trademarks, customer lists
☐ Exclude inventory and work in progress
☐ Exclude financial investments
☐ Exclude investment property (unless operational)
☐ Include only PPE and similar tangibles
```

### Error 3: Standalone vs. Consolidated Values

**Problem:** Using entity standalone carrying values instead of consolidated accounts.

**Solution:**
```
Value Source Verification:
├── Use values from consolidation package
├── Include purchase price allocations
├── Include fair value adjustments
├── Include revaluations (if applicable)
└── Document source clearly
```

### Error 4: Ignoring Location Adjustments

**Problem:** Claiming 100% of payroll/assets when employees or assets are mobile.

**Solution:**
```
Location Analysis:
├── Review employee travel records
├── Analyze asset location data
├── Apply pro-rata for <50% time in jurisdiction
├── Document location methodology
└── Maintain supporting records
```

### Error 5: Double-Counting Capitalized Payroll

**Problem:** Including payroll costs both in payroll carve-out AND as part of tangible assets.

**Solution:**
```
Capitalized Payroll Treatment:
├── Payroll capitalized into tangible assets:
│   └── Included in tangible asset carrying value
│   └── EXCLUDED from payroll carve-out
├── Payroll capitalized into intangibles (R&D):
│   └── INCLUDED in payroll carve-out
│   └── Not eligible for asset carve-out
└── Maintain clear allocation
```

### Error 6: Not Documenting Excess SBIE

**Problem:** SBIE exceeds GloBE Income but not properly recorded.

**Solution:**
```
Excess SBIE Documentation:
├── Calculate and record full SBIE amount
├── Note where SBIE > GloBE Income
├── Confirm Excess Profit = €0 (not negative)
├── Document lost excess for analysis
└── No carryforward - lost in current year
```

## 5.4.2.10 Key Takeaways

### Strategic Considerations for SBIE

1. **Maximize Transitional Benefits**
   - Higher rates in early years provide greater relief
   - FY 2024 rates (9.8%/7.8%) nearly double final rates (5%/5%)
   - Plan asset investments and hiring to maximize early-year SBIE

2. **Data Quality is Essential**
   - Accurate payroll records by jurisdiction
   - Complete fixed asset registers with location data
   - Consolidated carrying values, not standalone

3. **Location Tracking Matters**
   - Mobile employees and assets require pro-rata treatment
   - Establish tracking systems for cross-border workers
   - Document allocation methodology

4. **SBIE Cannot Be Transferred**
   - Excess SBIE in one jurisdiction is lost
   - Cannot offset Top-up Tax in other jurisdictions
   - Cannot carry forward to future years

5. **SBIE Applies Automatically**
   - Default treatment is to apply SBIE
   - Can elect NOT to apply (rarely beneficial)
   - Document election if made

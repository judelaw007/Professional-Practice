2. Immediately rewrite any inaccurate or outdated content with current information
3. Cite the specific web source (URL + date) for each correction

**WHAT TO VERIFY (via web search):**
- Dates, deadlines, and implementation timelines
- Statistical data, thresholds, and numerical figures
- Regulatory and legal references
- Industry standards and best practices
- Technical definitions and terminology
- Geographic/jurisdictional variations
- Organizational or institutional information

**SEARCH FOR AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES:**
1. Official regulatory/governing body websites
2. Government and institutional publications
3. Professional standards organizations
4. Leading industry firms and consultancies
5. Academic and research institutions
6. Official implementation/compliance trackers

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

**1. SEARCH LOG**
List the key web searches you conducted (minimum 15-20 searches)

**CRITICAL RULES:**
✓ Search first, correct immediately - every factual claim requires web verification
✓ Cite specific URLs with access dates for all corrections
✓ Preserve original style and structure unless accuracy demands changes
✓ If sources conflict, note this and recommend expert review
✓ No assumptions - if you can't verify via search, explicitly state this

Begin by conducting your web searches, then provide the corrected content.

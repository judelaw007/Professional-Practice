Audit the attached course section for consistency issues. Build/update a Master Reference Document to track standards across all sections.

**CRITICAL: DO NOT REWRITE**
- Fix only inconsistencies, contradictions, and redundancies
- Preserve the original author's voice, style, and structure
- Make minimal surgical edits

**MASTER REFERENCE DOCUMENT (create if first section, update if continuing):**

| Component | What to Track |
|-----------|---------------|
| Terminology Glossary | Term, standard usage, variations found, sections used |
| Concept Tracker | Where first introduced, where repeated, redundancy issues |
| Cross-Reference Map | Source section, target section, valid/broken status |
| Naming Conventions | Patterns for dates, currencies, percentages, references |
| Issues Log | Contradictions, terms to standardize, redundancies to remove |

**FIX ONLY:**
- Terminology variations → standardize to established term
- Redundant explanations → delete duplicates (keep first occurrence)
- Contradictions → correct to match authoritative source
- Broken cross-references → fix section numbers
- Inconsistent formats → apply standard pattern

**DO NOT CHANGE:** Accurate content, original explanations, author's style, structure

**OUTPUT:**

1. **Updated Master Reference Document** - all terms, concepts, issues logged
2. **Corrected Section** - original content with only consistency fixes
3. **Fix Log** - terminology standardized, redundancies removed, contradictions resolved, references fixed
4. **Next Section Notes** - conventions established, issues to watch for

**RULES:**
- Fix inconsistencies only
- Preserve original wording
- Minimal text changes
- Maintain author's voice

Begin by updating the Master Reference Document, then apply consistency fixes to the section.

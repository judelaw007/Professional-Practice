Conduct a comprehensive consistency audit of the attached course section. Build and maintain a master reference document that will guide consistency fixes across all course sections.

**IMPORTANT:** If this is your first section, create the master reference document. If continuing from a previous section, update the existing master reference document before fixing inconsistencies.

**CRITICAL: DO NOT REWRITE**
- Only fix inconsistencies, contradictions, and redundancies
- Preserve the original author's voice, style, and structure
- Make minimal edits - change only what's inconsistent or redundant
- Do not improve or enhance consistent content

**YOUR TASK:**

**Step 1: Update Master Reference Document**

Create or update a document containing:

**A. TERMINOLOGY GLOSSARY**
- Term | First Definition | Standard Usage | Variations Found | Sections Where Used
- Add new terms, flag conflicts with existing definitions

**B. CONCEPT TRACKER**
- Concept | Where First Introduced | Where Referenced Again | Issues
- Track redundant introductions

**C. CROSS-REFERENCE MAP**
- Reference Made | Source Section | Target Section | Status (Valid/Broken)

**D. NAMING CONVENTIONS LOG**
- Element Type | Pattern Used | Sections Affected

**E. ISSUES TO RESOLVE**
- Contradictions between sections
- Terms needing standardization
- Redundant content to remove

**Step 2: Fix Inconsistencies in Current Section**

Using the Master Reference Document, fix ONLY:
- Terminology variations (standardize to established term)
- Redundant content (delete duplicate explanations)
- Contradictions (fix conflicting information)
- Broken cross-references (correct section numbers)
- Inconsistent naming conventions (apply standard pattern)

**DO NOT change:**
- Accurate, consistent content
- Original explanations and examples
- Author's writing style or voice
- Structure unless absolutely necessary for consistency

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

**1. UPDATED MASTER REFERENCE DOCUMENT**
[Complete updated version with all new terms, concepts, and issues logged]

**2. CORRECTED SECTION**
[Original content with ONLY consistency fixes applied - all other text unchanged]

**3. FIX LOG FOR THIS SECTION**
- Terminology standardized: [list]
- Redundant content removed: [list]
- Contradictions resolved: [list]
- Cross-references fixed: [list]

**4. INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEXT SECTION**
[Note any terms, conventions, or issues the next section must address]

**CRITICAL RULES:**
✓ Fix inconsistencies only - do not rewrite consistent content
✓ Preserve original wording wherever possible
✓ Make surgical edits - change minimal text necessary
✓ Delete only truly redundant content
✓ Maintain author's voice and style completely

**For First Section:** Create the Master Reference Document
**For Subsequent Sections:** Provide existing Master Reference Document + new section

Begin by updating the Master Reference Document, then fix inconsistencies in the attached section.

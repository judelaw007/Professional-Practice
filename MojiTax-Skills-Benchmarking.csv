Pillar Two,CIOT Pillar Two Award Course,"Completed a Professional Practice Pillar Two Award course based on the CIOT syllabus. This case study designed course followed an MNE group through its first Pillar Two compliance cycle, with practical scenarios including computation of GloBE Income and Adjusted Covered Taxes, calculation of jurisdictional ETR and top-up tax under IIR/UTPR mechanisms, and preparation of GloBE Information Return filings.",GIR-001: GloBE Calculator,"Calculated jurisdictional ETR by dividing Adjusted Covered Taxes by GloBE Income for case study scenarios. Applied SBIE transition rates (10%/8% reducing to 5%) to payroll costs and tangible asset values to determine substance carve-outs. Computed top-up tax as the ETR deficit percentage multiplied by excess profit (GloBE Income minus SBIE)."
Pillar Two,,,GIR-002: Safe Harbour Qualifier,"Assessed jurisdictions against De Minimis thresholds (CbCR revenue <€10M AND profit <€1M) to identify automatic qualification. Applied Simplified ETR test using year-specific thresholds (15% for 2024, 16% for 2025, 17% for 2026) to CbCR-sourced data. Evaluated Routine Profits test by comparing CbCR profit to calculated SBIE amount."
Pillar Two,,,GIR-003: Filing Deadline Calculator,"Calculated GIR filing deadlines by adding 15 months to fiscal year-end dates for standard filings. Applied 18-month transitional extension for first-year GIR filings to determine extended deadlines. Identified jurisdiction-specific variations based on UPE location and filing entity selection."
Pillar Two,,,GIR-004: GIR Practice Form,"Populated GIR Section 1 (MNE Group Information) with entity hierarchy, ownership percentages, and jurisdiction classifications. Completed Section 2 (Safe Harbours and Exclusions) elections and Section 3 (GloBE Computations) with ETR and top-up tax data. Navigated the ~480 GIR data points with integrated reference guidance on format requirements and ERP source mapping."
Pillar Two,,,GIR-005: DFE Assessment Tool,"Evaluated Designated Filing Entity options by assessing which Constituent Entities meet jurisdiction requirements (Pillar Two implementation, GIR filing mechanism, exchange agreements). Analysed practical factors including data availability, systems capability, and coordination capacity across the MNE group. Determined notification obligations to all Constituent Entity jurisdictions following DFE election."
Pillar Two,,,GIR-006: Audit File Checklist,"Systematically verified documentation requirements across all GIR categories including GloBE Income adjustments, Covered Tax classifications, and SBIE calculations. Generated gap analysis reports identifying missing evidence before GIR submission. Organised supporting documentation to demonstrate compliance positions for tax authority inquiries."
